# Chapter 27: Financial Regulatory Agencies

## Executive Summary

The independent financial regulatory agencies of the United States — the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) — collectively safeguard the financial system that undergirds the entire American economy. They protect ordinary Americans from predatory lenders, fraudulent securities schemes, and the systemic risks that crashed the economy in 2008. These agencies were constructed through hard-won statutory authority, born of financial catastrophe and public demand for accountability. They are not bureaucratic abstractions; they are the institutional infrastructure that stands between working families and exploitation.

Project 2025 identified these agencies as primary targets for dismantlement. Its authors wrote explicitly of eliminating the CFPB's independent funding, restructuring the SEC to abandon "regulation by enforcement," and subjecting every independent regulatory commission to direct presidential control. Beginning in January 2025, the Trump administration executed this agenda with speed and deliberateness. Russell Vought closed the CFPB's headquarters, suspended all enforcement activity, and granted DOGE operatives access to confidential consumer financial data. Paul Atkins was installed at the SEC with a mandate to gut crypto oversight and abandon climate disclosure rules. The Financial Stability Oversight Council disbanded its climate risk committees and softened systemic risk warnings. The Basel III capital standards that would have prevented a repeat of Silicon Valley Bank's collapse were gutted before implementation. And the FHFA moved to begin a privatization process for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that threatens the availability of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for American homebuyers.

A Democratic administration must act immediately and comprehensively to reverse these actions and build a stronger, more durable financial regulatory architecture. The goal is not merely restoration to the pre-2025 status quo. The goal is transformation: agencies that are adequately funded, structurally insulated from political interference, equipped with 21st-century supervisory tools, and committed to the equitable enforcement of consumer protection and market integrity law.

**The Stakes**: The 2008 financial crisis cost American families approximately $19.2 trillion in net worth, triggered the deepest recession since the Great Depression, and left millions without homes, jobs, or retirement savings. The regulatory architecture built in its aftermath — the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB, enhanced capital standards, FSOC systemic risk oversight — was specifically designed to prevent recurrence. Project 2025 and the Trump administration have spent 2025 dismantling that architecture piece by piece. Each enforcement action dropped, each capital requirement weakened, each oversight body defunded represents a deliberate choice to expose ordinary Americans to financial predation and systemic risk. The next administration must treat financial regulatory restoration as a national security and economic justice imperative.

**Key Reforms**:
- Restore the CFPB to full operational capacity; reinstate all dismissed enforcement actions where legally recoverable; rebuild supervisory staff; and legislatively insulate the bureau's funding from future political attack
- Reverse all Project 2025 enforcement freezes at the SEC; restore the climate disclosure rule; establish a mandatory crypto regulatory framework that protects retail investors
- Reinstate the Basel III endgame capital standards in full to ensure the largest banks hold adequate capital against systemic risk
- Reject Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac privatization; pursue statutory reform that preserves the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, expands affordable housing access, and eliminates the conservatorship limbo
- Restore FSOC systemic risk oversight, including climate-related financial risk committees; designate systemically important non-bank financial institutions
- Restore and expand PCAOB independence and budget; resist any effort to fold PCAOB functions into the SEC
- Establish a statutory framework for stablecoin and digital asset regulation that provides clarity without abandoning investor protection
- Prohibit the inclusion of medical debt on consumer credit reports; restore the CFPB payday lending rule's ability-to-repay requirements; reinstate the credit card late fee rule consistent with the CARD Act
- Pursue statutory amendments to the Consumer Financial Protection Act (12 U.S.C. § 5481 et seq.) to reinforce CFPB independence against future removal-power litigation
- Restore Community Reinvestment Act enforcement across all federal banking regulators
- Restore CFTC derivatives market oversight; reinstate mandatory clearing requirements for standardized swaps; restore position limits for commodity derivatives; reverse Volcker Rule rollbacks
- Enact revolving-door structural reforms to prevent regulatory capture through mandatory cooling-off periods and enhanced financial disclosure requirements for all senior regulatory appointees
- Conduct Inspector General investigation of all DOGE access to confidential financial regulatory data and pursue accountability for unauthorized disclosure of consumer financial information

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. §§ 5481–5603); Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub. L. 111-203); Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq.); Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.); Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.); Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1811 et seq.); National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq.); Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-204); Federal Deposit Insurance Act, systemic risk exception (12 U.S.C. § 1823(c)(4)(G)); Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 551–559); *Seila Law LLC v. CFPB*, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); *Collins v. Yellen*, 594 U.S. 220 (2021); *CFPB v. Community Financial Services Association of America*, 601 U.S. 416 (2024); *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo*, 603 U.S. 369 (2024).

## Part I: Project 2025 Financial Regulatory Damage and Destruction

### Damage Area 1: The Systematic Destruction of the CFPB

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership identified the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a structural threat to the free market and called explicitly for eliminating its independent funding through the Federal Reserve System. The authors wrote that the CFPB should be "abolished" or, failing that, subjected to full congressional appropriations control, a change that would expose every enforcement decision to political override.

The Trump administration did not wait for legislation. On February 1, 2025, Russell Vought — simultaneously serving as Director of the Office of Management and Budget — was named Acting Director of the CFPB. Within days, Vought issued a directive closing the bureau's Washington headquarters, ordering all supervisory and examination activity to cease, instructing staff to suspend all pending rules and investigations, and placing hundreds of employees on administrative leave. The CFPB's statutory mandate under 12 U.S.C. § 5511 — to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices — was effectively suspended by executive fiat.

Simultaneously, DOGE operatives, acting under Elon Musk's direction and with Vought's authorization, gained access to the CFPB's full data systems on February 7, 2025. These systems contain highly sensitive consumer financial data, including bank examination records, enforcement investigation files, confidential supervisory information, consumer complaint data, and non-public business information about financial institutions. Security experts described this access as "god-tier" — access that under normal circumstances only specific case-assigned examiners would possess. The Electronic Privacy Information Center warned that the access violated 12 U.S.C. § 5534's confidentiality protections for consumer complaint data and created conditions for market manipulation, given that Musk's X Money payment platform competes directly with the nonbank payment services the CFPB regulates.

In 2025, the Vought-led CFPB dismissed more than 40 public enforcement actions — actions that, in their entirety, represented potentially over $3 billion in consumer redress. Notable dismissals included:

- The enforcement action against Capital One for allegedly cheating customers out of approximately $2 billion in interest on savings accounts
- The action against Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance for predatory loan origination practices targeting low-income families in manufactured housing communities
- The action against Rocket Homes for allegedly providing unlawful kickbacks to real estate brokers in exchange for mortgage referrals
- The action against TransUnion for allegedly violating a prior CFPB order

In its 14-year history prior to January 2025, the CFPB had dropped a pending enforcement action exactly once. The Vought-led bureau dropped 40 in a single year.

The CFPB also abandoned the credit card late fee rule — promulgated under 15 U.S.C. § 1665d (the CARD Act) — which would have capped late fees for large card issuers at $8, down from over $30. The bureau jointly moved with plaintiff industry groups to vacate the rule, conceding the rule was invalid, a position that reversed years of legal analysis and represented a windfall to the credit card industry worth an estimated $10 billion annually in fees extracted from cardholders.

The Trump administration and House Republicans also moved to cut the CFPB's budget by 70 percent through the reconciliation process, a step that would gut the bureau's supervisory workforce and eliminate its capacity to conduct meaningful bank examinations.

### Damage Area 2: SEC Deregulation and the Abandonment of Investor Protection

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 called for the SEC to abandon "regulation by enforcement" in the crypto space, limit ESG-related disclosure requirements, and reorient the commission toward a permissive stance on financial innovation. Paul Atkins, confirmed as SEC Chair in 2025, executed this agenda with precision.

The SEC's first major act under Atkins was abandoning the defense of the Climate Disclosure Rule finalized by the Gensler-led commission in March 2024. That rule — promulgated under the SEC's authority under 15 U.S.C. § 78l and § 78o — required publicly traded companies to disclose material climate-related risks, greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 categories, and climate-related financial impacts in annual reports and registration statements. On March 27, 2025, the SEC notified the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that it would withdraw its defense of the rule. The SEC subsequently voted to formally vacate the rule, and withdrew related proposed ESG disclosure rules that would have governed proxy voting and shareholder submissions.

On crypto, Atkins launched "Project Crypto," an internal initiative to systematically dismantle the enforcement posture developed under Gary Gensler. The SEC:

- Dismissed the enforcement action against Binance Holdings Limited in May 2025
- Dropped three separate enforcement actions in June 2025 against entities charged with operating as unregistered securities dealers
- Reduced the crypto enforcement unit from 50 to approximately 30 staff
- Signaled it would adopt a "token taxonomy" declaring that digital commodities, network tokens, and digital collectibles are categorically not securities, a determination that would place large swaths of the crypto market beyond SEC jurisdiction

This crypto deregulation agenda proceeds without statutory authorization. The Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) and the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq.) establish jurisdictional boundaries that require legislative action to alter. The SEC's effort to redefine asset categories through administrative guidance rather than rulemaking or statute circumvents the Administrative Procedure Act's notice-and-comment requirements and removes investor protection without public accountability.

### Damage Area 3: Banking Regulatory Rollback — Capital Standards and Systemic Risk

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 called for rolling back post-2008 bank capital requirements, arguing they constrained credit availability and placed American banks at a competitive disadvantage. The Trump administration accomplished this rollback both through the abandonment of the Basel III endgame proposal and through the installation of deregulation-committed leadership at the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve.

The Basel III endgame proposal, published jointly by the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC in July 2023, would have significantly strengthened capital requirements for large banks — requiring them to hold substantially more capital against the risks of complex trading operations, operational failures, and credit exposure. These requirements responded directly to the lessons of Silicon Valley Bank's March 2023 collapse, in which inadequate capital against interest rate risk allowed a bank with over $200 billion in assets to fail overnight.

The Trump administration's new leadership at all three agencies signaled in early 2025 that the original proposal would not be finalized in its original form. The modified rule issued in November 2025 preserved some technical capital adjustments but dramatically softened the original requirements — reducing Tier 1 capital requirements by as much as 28 percent for applicable depository institutions. The result is a banking system that remains more exposed to the kind of concentrated interest rate and credit risk that brought down SVB and threatened to cascade into broader financial instability.

The FSOC — the interagency council established by Dodd-Frank at 12 U.S.C. § 5321 to identify and respond to systemic financial risk — was transformed from a risk-identification body into a deregulation committee. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent disbanded the FSOC's climate-related financial risk committees in September 2025. The council's 2025 annual report adopted a "softer" tone toward crypto assets and removed previous warnings about structural financial vulnerabilities. The FSOC met fewer times in 2025 than in any prior year since its founding.

### Damage Area 4: The FHFA Privatization Threat to the 30-Year Mortgage

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 called for ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that guarantee approximately 70 percent of all mortgage loans in the United States — and releasing them as private shareholder-owned entities without an explicit federal backstop. This proposal has been a conservative policy objective since the GSEs were placed into FHFA conservatorship in September 2008, a government intervention that cost taxpayers approximately $191 billion before the GSEs repaid those draws through subsequent profits.

FHFA Director Bill Pulte, appointed by Trump in 2025, began the process of moving toward privatization. By mid-2025, the administration announced plans for an initial public offering that could raise approximately $30 billion through sale of GSE shares. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other legislators raised conflict-of-interest questions about Pulte's relationships with private investors who stood to benefit from GSE privatization.

The threat to American homebuyers is direct and severe. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage — a uniquely American financial product that provides homebuyers with payment certainty across three decades — exists because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase these mortgages from originators and bundle them into mortgage-backed securities. This secondary market function allows lenders to originate long-term, fixed-rate mortgages without carrying the interest rate risk for 30 years. Without a federal guarantee, investors in mortgage-backed securities would demand higher returns to compensate for increased risk, driving up mortgage rates. Capital requirements for newly private GSEs could require them to increase guarantee fees charged to lenders, further raising borrowing costs. The Congressional Budget Office and independent housing economists have estimated that GSE privatization without explicit government guarantee could add 60 to 90 basis points to mortgage rates — an increase that would price hundreds of thousands of families out of homeownership.

### Damage Area 5: PCAOB Independence Undermined

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board was established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-204) in direct response to the Enron and WorldCom accounting frauds, which wiped out billions in investor savings. The PCAOB inspects auditors of public companies, sets auditing standards, and investigates and disciplines audit failures. Its independence from both the corporations it oversees and from political direction was a deliberate design choice.

In 2025, the House Financial Services Committee voted to advance a bill that would abolish the PCAOB and transfer its functions to the SEC — removing an independent layer of oversight and placing audit quality supervision directly under an SEC chair already committed to deregulation. While that provision was ultimately removed from the Big Beautiful Budget Act before final passage, the threat to the PCAOB's institutional existence remained credible.

The SEC, under Atkins, approved a 2026 PCAOB budget of $362 million — 9.4 percent below the prior year. The SEC simultaneously cut the PCAOB's accounting support fee by 18.4 percent and slashed compensation for the board's chair and members by 52 and 42 percent respectively. These cuts are not administrative efficiencies; they are designed to reduce the PCAOB's enforcement capacity and signal to its leadership that independence carries institutional risk.

### Damage Area 6: CFTC Derivatives Oversight and the Volcker Rule Rollback

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees the $700 trillion global derivatives market — swaps, futures, and options contracts that underpin risk management across agriculture, energy, finance, and manufacturing. The unregulated over-the-counter derivatives market was the single largest contributor to the systemic risk that caused the 2008 financial crisis. AIG's unregulated credit default swap positions, which required a $182 billion government bailout, demonstrated precisely what happens when derivatives trades occur outside regulated exchanges and without mandatory clearing.

Project 2025 called for the CFTC to abandon the Dodd-Frank mandate to require clearing and exchange trading for standardized swaps, arguing that mandatory clearing and margin requirements raised the cost of hedging for commercial end users. The Trump administration moved to weaken mandatory clearing requirements and position limits for commodity derivatives — the rules that prevent a single speculative trader from cornering a market.

The Volcker Rule — enacted under Dodd-Frank § 619 (12 U.S.C. § 1851) to prohibit banks from engaging in proprietary trading with federally insured deposits — was already significantly weakened in 2019. The Trump administration's 2025 financial deregulation push sought further dilution of the rule's covered fund restrictions, which prevent banks from owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds using insured deposit capital. These restrictions exist specifically to prevent the conflict of interest that arises when deposit-taking institutions gamble with customer funds.

The administration also moved to weaken position limit rules for commodity derivatives under 7 U.S.C. § 6a — limits that prevent excessive speculation in commodities markets from driving price spikes in food, fuel, and agricultural products. Excessive speculation in oil futures markets contributed to gasoline price spikes that cost American households billions; relaxing these limits repeats a mistake for which ordinary consumers bear the cost.

**The Impact on Derivatives Transparency:**

Dodd-Frank Title VII mandated that standardized over-the-counter swap transactions be cleared through central counterparties and reported to swap data repositories, bringing transparency to a market that operated entirely in the dark before 2008. The CFTC under the Trump administration reduced examination staff and enforcement resources, making it increasingly difficult to monitor compliance with swap reporting requirements. Banks and large financial institutions that operate in the swaps market face reduced supervision — a direct replication of the pre-2008 conditions that produced systemic catastrophe.

### The Human Cost

The human cost of Project 2025's financial regulatory agenda is not abstract. The damage is measured in dollars drained from working families, in systemic risks that will materialize as the next financial crisis, and in the erosion of the consumer confidence that makes financial markets function.

**Consumer Redress Lost:**
The 42 enforcement actions the CFPB dismissed represented an estimated $3 billion or more in potential consumer redress — money owed to individuals who were overcharged, deceived, or subjected to illegal practices by financial institutions. Approximately $360 million in already-negotiated consumer settlements were canceled or put at risk when the Trump CFPB terminated agreements with corporations that had violated consumer financial law. These were not prospective penalties — they were recovery agreements already signed, already due to consumers, already owed.

**Ongoing Fee Extraction:**
The abandonment of the credit card late fee rule leaves consumers subject to late fees exceeding $30 for large card issuers. The credit card industry extracts an estimated $10 billion annually in late fees from cardholders — a burden that falls disproportionately on low- and moderate-income Americans who carry revolving balances. These are families one unexpected expense away from a missed payment, for whom a $32 fee compounds into a debt spiral that the credit card industry's business model is designed to perpetuate.

**Data Exposure:**
The DOGE access to CFPB consumer data exposed sensitive financial information of millions of Americans to individuals with direct commercial conflicts of interest in the regulated industries. Elon Musk, whose X Money payment platform competes directly with PayPal, Venmo, and CashApp — all entities subject to CFPB supervision — obtained access through DOGE to the CFPB's full supervisory and enforcement databases. This is not a procedural irregularity; it is the use of executive power to hand a competitor market intelligence gathered through government compulsion.

**Systemic Risk Re-Creation:**
The softened Basel III capital requirements leave the banking system more vulnerable to the kind of rapid-onset stress that collapsed Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023. SVB's failure — which required the federal government to invoke the systemic risk exception under 12 U.S.C. § 1823(c)(4)(G) to protect all depositors, including those above FDIC insurance limits — demonstrated that inadequate capital requirements can create bank-run dynamics within hours. The administration's rollback of capital rules, combined with the weakening of FSOC's systemic risk monitoring, recreates precisely the conditions that made SVB's failure a near-systemic event.

**The Homeownership Threat:**
GSE privatization, if completed without an explicit government guarantee, could add 60 to 90 basis points to mortgage rates. On a $400,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, a 75-basis-point rate increase costs the borrower approximately $1,800 per year in additional interest — $54,000 over the life of the loan. This is not a marginal cost. It is a barrier to homeownership that falls hardest on first-time buyers with smaller down payments and less financial flexibility, the precise population that the GSE system was built to serve.

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

Congress derives authority to regulate financial markets, protect consumers, and establish independent regulatory agencies from multiple constitutional provisions. The Commerce Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3) grants Congress plenary authority over interstate commerce, which encompasses the entirety of the nation's financial system. The Necessary and Proper Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18) allows Congress to create regulatory agencies with the structural independence necessary to carry out enumerated powers. The Taxing and Spending Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1) undergirds Congress's authority to fund regulatory bodies, including through mechanisms — like the CFPB's Federal Reserve funding draw — that insulate them from annual appropriations cycles.

The Supreme Court's decision in *Seila Law LLC v. CFPB*, 591 U.S. 197 (2020), struck down the statutory "for cause" removal protection for the CFPB director as an unconstitutional restriction on presidential removal authority, holding that such protection violated separation of powers where the agency was led by a single director rather than a multi-member commission. *Collins v. Yellen*, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), extended this principle to the FHFA director. These decisions have constrained the structural independence of single-director agencies. However, they do not: (1) require abolition of these agencies; (2) prohibit Congress from restructuring them as multi-member commissions whose members would receive stronger removal protections; (3) authorize the president to suspend enforcement of statutory mandates; or (4) permit disclosure of confidential supervisory information to DOGE operatives without statutory authority.

Critically, the Supreme Court's decision in *CFPB v. Community Financial Services Association of America*, 601 U.S. 416 (2024), unanimously upheld the CFPB's Federal Reserve funding mechanism against Appropriations Clause challenge. The Court held that Congress has broad authority to fund agencies through sources other than annual appropriations, settling the constitutional question the industry had most aggressively pursued.

The presidential removal of agency heads for reasons other than cause — even where constitutionally permitted — does not authorize the suspension of statutory duties. The CFPB's obligation under 12 U.S.C. § 5511 to "protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices" is a statutory mandate that survives changes in agency leadership. Vought's directive to cease all enforcement activity constitutes a failure to faithfully execute the laws, in violation of U.S. Const. art. II, § 3.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010** (12 U.S.C. §§ 5481–5603): Establishes the CFPB, defines its authority over consumer financial products, sets the bureau's mission, grants enforcement powers including civil money penalties under § 5565, and establishes the Federal Reserve funding mechanism under § 5497.

**Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act** (Pub. L. 111-203, 12 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq.): Creates the comprehensive post-2008 regulatory framework including the FSOC (§ 5321), authority to designate systemically important financial institutions (§ 5323), enhanced prudential standards for large banks (§ 5365), the Volcker Rule restricting proprietary trading (§ 1851), and the CFPB itself (Title X).

**Securities Exchange Act of 1934** (15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq.): Establishes the SEC, governs securities registration and disclosure, grants rulemaking authority including authority over material risk disclosure, and establishes enforcement mechanisms including disgorgement, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.

**Securities Act of 1933** (15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.): Governs initial registration of securities offerings and imposes disclosure requirements on issuers.

**Commodity Exchange Act** (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.): Establishes CFTC jurisdiction over derivatives, futures, and commodity markets; grants authority to regulate swaps under Dodd-Frank Title VII; provides the legal basis for cryptocurrency jurisdiction disputes.

**Federal Deposit Insurance Act** (12 U.S.C. § 1811 et seq.): Establishes the FDIC, defines deposit insurance coverage, and grants the FDIC supervisory authority over state-chartered non-member banks and backup examination authority over all insured depository institutions.

**Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002** (Pub. L. 107-204): Establishes the PCAOB as an independent auditor oversight body under SEC oversight; establishes criminal penalties for securities fraud and auditor misconduct.

**Home Owners' Loan Act / Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008** (12 U.S.C. § 4511 et seq.): Establishes the FHFA and grants it authority over Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks; establishes FHFA conservatorship authority.

**Fair Credit Reporting Act** (15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.): Governs consumer credit reporting and grants the CFPB rulemaking authority over credit reporting practices, including the authority to restrict medical debt reporting pursuant to the 2025 final rule.

### Supremacy of Congressional Statutory Mandates Over Executive Non-Enforcement

The fundamental constitutional principle at issue in the Vought CFPB actions is the duty to faithfully execute the laws.

U.S. Const. art. II, § 3 provides that the President "shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." This obligation extends to agencies operating under statutory mandates. When Congress directs the CFPB to enforce federal consumer financial law, that direction cannot be nullified by an acting director's email to staff.

The dismissal of 42 enforcement actions — actions representing billions in consumer harm, pursued by career attorneys on the basis of evidence gathered through formal examination — is not an exercise of prosecutorial discretion within a functioning regulatory system. It is a wholesale suspension of statutory authority.

The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 553) requires that agency policy changes go through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Where the CFPB abandoned final rules — including the credit card late fee rule and the payday lending ability-to-repay requirements — without complying with notice-and-comment procedures, those abandonments are unlawful and subject to judicial reversal.

The Supreme Court's decision in *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo*, 603 U.S. 369 (2024), overruled *Chevron* deference and requires courts to independently interpret agency statutory authority. This ruling cuts both ways. It removes the administrative convenience of deference when agencies expand their authority — but it also requires courts to assess independently whether an agency's refusal to enforce a statutory mandate is consistent with the statute's text. Where Congress directed the CFPB to "take any action to prevent a covered person or service provider from committing or engaging in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice" (12 U.S.C. § 5531(b)), a blanket enforcement freeze is not a permissible interpretation of that mandate. It is a violation of it.

### Regulatory Coordination and the Problem of Agency Capture

A persistent structural vulnerability in American financial regulation is the potential for regulated entities to capture the agencies that oversee them. Regulatory capture occurs through multiple pathways: the revolving door between industry and regulatory positions; the information asymmetries that make agencies dependent on industry data; the political funding relationships between financial industry donors and the legislators who control agency appropriations; and the ideological alignment between deregulatory political movements and industry interests.

The Trump administration's actions in 2025 represent a systematic exploitation of all four capture pathways simultaneously. Russell Vought — who is not a financial regulator and has no background in consumer financial protection — was installed as CFPB acting director for the express purpose of dismantling the bureau. Paul Atkins — who spent his post-SEC career as a consultant to financial industry clients seeking lighter regulation — was installed as SEC chair. Scott Bessent — a former hedge fund manager — leads the Treasury and chairs the FSOC. Bill Pulte — with significant ties to private investors positioned to profit from GSE privatization — leads the FHFA.

This is not incidental. It is the Project 2025 strategy explicitly stated: install leaders whose objective is not effective agency function but systematic agency dismantlement. The next administration's structural response must include not merely replacing personnel but building institutional features that reduce the effectiveness of capture tactics across future administrations.

Required structural reforms include:

- Mandatory cooling-off periods of no less than three years before former financial industry executives may serve in supervisory roles over their former employers, extending and codifying the existing revolving-door ethics rules under 18 U.S.C. § 207
- Required financial disclosure and recusal from all matters involving entities with which senior regulatory officials had a financial relationship within five years of appointment
- Statutory prohibition on serving simultaneously as the head of two agencies — as Vought served as both OMB Director and CFPB Acting Director — when the agencies have conflicting statutory mandates
- Annual congressional testimony by all independent financial regulatory agency heads on their enforcement activities, including specific questioning on any enforcement action dismissed, suspended, or not filed in the prior year
- Inspector General authority to investigate all enforcement action dismissals at independent financial regulatory agencies, with a statutory requirement that IGs report directly to Congress on any pattern of politically motivated enforcement suspension

---

## Part III: Comprehensive Financial Regulatory Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: CFPB Full Restoration and Structural Strengthening

**Immediate Executive Actions:**

Issue an executive order directing the CFPB Acting Director to immediately reinstate all enforcement staff from administrative leave and restore all supervisory examination activities as required under 12 U.S.C. § 5514 and § 5515. Direct the CFPB to conduct a legal review of all enforcement actions dismissed between January 20, 2025 and the administration's first day, with a mandate to refile all actions where the statute of limitations permits and evidence supports.

Issue a Presidential Memorandum directing the CFPB to restore full operations of the consumer complaint database under 12 U.S.C. § 5534, enforce the confidentiality of all supervisory information under 12 U.S.C. § 5534(b), and revoke DOGE access to any CFPB system containing consumer financial data, bank examination records, or confidential supervisory information.

**Regulatory Restoration:**

Reinstate the credit card late fee rule consistent with CARD Act authority under 15 U.S.C. § 1665d, revised as necessary to address the Texas district court's legal objections while preserving the core consumer protection objective of limiting excessive penalty fees.

Reinstate the payday lending rule's ability-to-repay provisions under the CFPB's authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices under 12 U.S.C. § 5531. The ability-to-repay requirement — the provision the industry fought hardest to kill — is the rule's critical consumer protection. The Trump CFPB's decision not to enforce even the surviving payment provisions of the payday rule must be immediately reversed.

Affirm and enforce the medical debt credit reporting prohibition finalized in January 2025 under 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. Medical debt appears on the credit reports of approximately 15 million Americans, suppresses credit scores by an average of 10 points, and bears no predictive relationship to creditworthiness — a conclusion supported by the Federal Reserve's own research. This prohibition must be maintained.

Restore and expand student loan servicer supervision under 12 U.S.C. § 5514, with specific attention to servicers' compliance with income-driven repayment plan enrollment procedures and their obligations under the Loan Servicer Examination Procedures established by the CFPB.

**Legislative Agenda:**

Pursue the CFPB Structural Independence Act to restructure the bureau as a five-member bipartisan commission. Multi-member commission structure provides stronger removal protections against future *Seila Law*-based attacks by restoring the traditional independent-agency model the Supreme Court distinguished in that decision. Commission members would be appointed by the President with Senate confirmation to staggered five-year terms and removable only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.

Pursue statutory amendment to codify the CFPB's Federal Reserve funding mechanism in a form that makes explicit the insulation from congressional appropriations, building on the Supreme Court's unanimous ruling in *CFPB v. Community Financial Services Association of America*, 601 U.S. 416 (2024).

### Reform II: Restoring SEC Market Integrity and Investor Protection

**Immediate Executive Actions:**

Direct the SEC to immediately reinstate the Climate Disclosure Rule under 15 U.S.C. § 78l and § 78o, withdraw the vacatur, and return the rule to the Eighth Circuit for consideration on the merits. The rule's disclosure requirements address material financial risks — risks that institutional investors, pension funds, and insurance companies require to make informed capital allocation decisions. Withdrawing the rule deprives markets of material information and violates the SEC's core mandate.

Direct the SEC to restore the crypto enforcement unit to full staffing of no fewer than 50 enforcement attorneys and specialists. The unit's reduction from 50 to 30 staff — a 40 percent cut — occurred simultaneously with the most rapid growth of retail crypto speculation in years, leaving millions of retail investors without adequate enforcement protection.

**Regulatory Restoration:**

Conduct a comprehensive review of all enforcement actions dismissed by the Atkins SEC and refile where legally supportable. Issue formal guidance clarifying that the SEC's jurisdictional determination of whether a crypto asset is a security follows the *Howey* test established by the Supreme Court in *SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.*, 328 U.S. 293 (1946), not an administrative token taxonomy determined by internal SEC bulletin.

Propose and finalize rules establishing a comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework that: (1) requires registration and disclosure by digital asset issuers whose tokens meet the *Howey* investment contract test; (2) establishes exchange registration requirements for platforms trading investment-contract crypto assets; (3) creates appropriate risk disclosure requirements for retail participants; and (4) coordinates with CFTC jurisdiction over commodity-category digital assets through a joint regulatory framework.

Restore the proposed ESG disclosure rules for proxy voting and shareholder submissions under the SEC's authority over proxy solicitation under 15 U.S.C. § 78n.

**Legislative Agenda:**

Pursue the Digital Asset Market Structure Act to provide statutory clarity on the SEC/CFTC jurisdictional divide for digital assets, require registration of digital asset exchanges and trading platforms, mandate investor disclosures comparable to those required for securities, and establish anti-manipulation rules applicable to cryptocurrency markets. This framework must be enacted through statute — not SEC guidance bulletins — to provide durable legal authority.

Pursue the Investor Protection Modernization Act to restore mandatory climate and ESG risk disclosure in a form expressly authorized by statute, removing any Administrative Procedure Act objections by grounding the disclosure obligation directly in the securities laws.

### Reform III: Banking Capital Standards and Systemic Risk Regulation

**Immediate Executive Actions:**

Direct the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve to jointly publish a notice of proposed rulemaking reinstating the July 2023 Basel III endgame capital proposal in its original form, as required by prudential regulation authority under 12 U.S.C. § 1831o (the prompt corrective action framework) and the Federal Reserve's authority under 12 U.S.C. § 1844. The modified rule issued in November 2025, which reduced capital requirements by as much as 28 percent for applicable institutions, must be reversed.

Direct the FSOC to reinstate the climate-related financial risk committees disbanded by Treasury Secretary Bessent in September 2025. Climate-related financial risk is a systemic risk within the FSOC's statutory mandate under 12 U.S.C. § 5322(a)(2)(K) to identify "risks to the financial stability of the United States." The FSOC's 2025 annual report's softened risk assessment of crypto assets and disbanding of climate risk committees represented a political override of the council's technical function.

**Regulatory Restoration:**

Restore the FSOC's authority and capacity to designate non-bank financial institutions as systemically important under 12 U.S.C. § 5323. The Trump administration's 2019 guidance that effectively eliminated non-bank SIFI designations must be rescinded. The growth of the private credit market — now exceeding $1.7 trillion in assets under management — and the expansion of fintech payment platforms create systemic risk concentrations that fall outside traditional bank regulatory perimeters.

Direct the FDIC to reinstate strong Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) examination procedures under 12 U.S.C. § 2906 and coordinate with OCC and Federal Reserve to restore the 2023 joint CRA final rule that the Trump administration moved to vacate. The CRA is the primary statutory tool for ensuring that banks meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities in their assessment areas.

**Legislative Agenda:**

Pursue the Financial Stability Preservation Act to codify FSOC's climate risk assessment mandate in statute, eliminating any future administration's ability to disband these committees through administrative directive. Amend 12 U.S.C. § 5322 to explicitly list climate-related financial risk as a category the FSOC must assess in each annual report.

Pursue statutory enhancement of the FDIC's receivership tools to ensure that the emergency mechanisms used in the SVB resolution — including the systemic risk exception under 12 U.S.C. § 1823(c)(4)(G) — are funded and available without requiring extraordinary Treasury approvals that introduce political delay into crisis response.

### Reform IV: GSE Reform — Preserving and Expanding the 30-Year Mortgage

**Immediate Executive Actions:**

Issue a presidential directive to the FHFA Director suspending any privatization or IPO proceedings for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pending congressional action. The FHFA's conservatorship authority under 12 U.S.C. § 4617 grants broad powers to stabilize the GSEs; it does not authorize the FHFA Director to pursue a privatization designed to benefit private equity investors at the expense of mortgage market stability.

Direct the FHFA to conduct a comprehensive stress test of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under adverse interest rate and housing price scenarios, including scenarios modeled on the 2008 housing crisis, and to publish the full results. This stress test must precede any policy decision on conservatorship exit.

**Legislative Agenda:**

Pursue the GSE Stability and Homeownership Act to establish a statutory framework for a post-conservatorship Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that: (1) preserves explicit federal government backstop for GSE mortgage-backed securities, eliminating the uncertainty that would raise rates under a fully private model; (2) requires the GSEs to hold adequate capital against stress scenarios; (3) expands affordable housing goals under 12 U.S.C. § 4561 to require that a meaningful percentage of GSE guarantee activity serve low- and moderate-income borrowers; (4) prohibits GSE privatization without prior congressional authorization; and (5) establishes a dedicated affordable housing fund financed by GSE guarantee fees.

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is not a market inevitability — it exists because of deliberate government policy. Preserving it requires a statutory framework that makes the government guarantee explicit, not a privatization gamble that would expose American homebuyers to rate volatility and mortgage market instability.

### Reform V: PCAOB Independence and Audit Quality Restoration

**Immediate Executive Actions:**

Direct the SEC to restore the PCAOB's 2025 budget to its prior-year levels, reverse the compensation cuts imposed on PCAOB board members, and publicly commit to preserving PCAOB institutional independence from political interference. The PCAOB's funding comes from accounting support fees assessed on public companies under Sarbanes-Oxley § 109 (15 U.S.C. § 7219) — not from congressional appropriations or SEC discretionary funds. The SEC's unilateral budget reduction constitutes an impermissible intrusion on the PCAOB's congressionally mandated independence.

**Regulatory Restoration:**

Direct the PCAOB to reinstate full inspections of the largest accounting firms, including the Big Four, with particular attention to compliance with audit standards for financial institutions — the sector most exposed to the capital standard rollbacks described above. Direct the PCAOB to reinstate and complete all enforcement investigations that were suspended or slowed during the budget-cut period.

Restore full PCAOB oversight of Chinese-headquartered public company auditors under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (Pub. L. 116-222). The PCAOB's 2022 determination that it was unable to fully inspect Chinese-registered accounting firms — and its subsequent 2022 agreement with Chinese securities regulators enabling inspections — represented a significant advance in protecting American investors in Chinese-listed securities. Any backsliding on this access under the Trump administration must be immediately reversed.

**Legislative Agenda:**

Pursue the Audit Independence Protection Act to codify the PCAOB's structural independence in statute, explicitly prohibiting the SEC from: (1) reducing the PCAOB budget below the level required for full inspection of registered accounting firms; (2) merging PCAOB functions into the SEC; or (3) overriding PCAOB enforcement decisions through informal pressure. Increase criminal penalties under Sarbanes-Oxley § 807 (18 U.S.C. § 1348) for securities fraud by auditors who provide false or misleading certifications of financial statements.

### Reform VI: Stablecoin and Digital Asset Regulatory Framework

**Immediate Executive Actions:**

Issue a presidential memorandum directing the Treasury Department, CFPB, SEC, CFTC, and FDIC to convene a 60-day interagency working group to produce a unified digital asset regulatory framework with clear jurisdictional assignments and consistent consumer protection standards across agencies. The Trump administration's deregulatory approach to crypto created a regulatory vacuum that exposes retail investors to fraud, market manipulation, and exchange failures of the kind seen in the collapse of FTX.

Direct the CFPB to assert supervisory authority over large stablecoin issuers and non-bank payment platforms — including those operated by technology companies — as covered persons engaged in consumer financial services under 12 U.S.C. § 5481(6) and § 5514. The Trump administration's disbanding of CFPB oversight of these platforms, combined with Vought's halt on all CFPB supervision, created a specific regulatory gap for the fastest-growing segment of consumer financial activity.

**Legislative Agenda:**

Pursue the Stablecoin Safety and Consumer Protection Act to require that: (1) stablecoin issuers hold 1:1 reserves in cash and short-term Treasury securities, subject to third-party audit under PCAOB standards; (2) stablecoin issuers register with the Federal Reserve or an appropriate state banking regulator; (3) consumer protections apply to stablecoin holders equivalent to those governing bank deposits, including loss protection in the event of issuer insolvency; and (4) foreign stablecoin issuers serving U.S. customers comply with these requirements.

Pursue the Digital Asset Anti-Fraud Act to extend existing securities anti-fraud provisions under 15 U.S.C. § 78j and Rule 10b-5 to cover all digital asset transactions involving U.S. persons, regardless of whether the underlying asset is classified as a security, commodity, or currency.

### Reform VII: CFTC and Derivatives Market Integrity

**Immediate Executive Actions:**

Issue a presidential memorandum directing the CFTC to reinstate full examination schedules for designated contract markets, swap execution facilities, and swap data repositories under 7 U.S.C. § 7. The reduction in CFTC examination staff under the Trump administration has created supervision gaps in markets whose total notional value exceeds the annual GDP of the entire global economy.

Direct the CFTC to reaffirm the mandatory clearing requirements for standardized interest rate swaps and credit default swaps under 7 U.S.C. § 2(h) and to publish a public report on current market clearing rates. The move away from mandatory clearing — even at the margins — recreates the opacity that made AIG's derivative book unknowable to regulators until it was too late.

Direct the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve to jointly review all modifications to the Volcker Rule's covered fund restrictions made since January 2025 and reinstate any restrictions that were removed without complying with the APA's notice-and-comment requirements under 5 U.S.C. § 553.

**Regulatory Restoration:**

Restore the CFTC's position limit rules for commodity derivatives under 7 U.S.C. § 6a in full, including speculative position limits for agricultural commodities, energy products, and metals. Position limits prevent any single trader or coordinated group of traders from accumulating enough market power to distort commodity prices — a protection that directly affects the food and energy costs paid by every American family.

Restore and fully implement the CFTC's 2020 Swap Dealer Margin Rule requirements to ensure that uncleared swaps carry adequate initial and variation margin requirements. The margin rules, promulgated under Dodd-Frank Title VII, prevent the kind of uncollateralized derivative exposure that required AIG's bailout.

**Legislative Agenda:**

Pursue the Derivatives Market Transparency Act to codify mandatory clearing requirements for standardized swaps in statute, prohibiting any future administration from administratively exempting swap categories from clearing through informal guidance. Amend 7 U.S.C. § 2(h) to establish a statutory presumption that standardized swaps are subject to mandatory clearing absent a specific congressional finding that clearing is impractical.

Pursue restoration of the Volcker Rule's full covered fund restrictions through statutory amendment to 12 U.S.C. § 1851, eliminating the 2019 and any subsequent regulatory rollbacks that expanded the range of fund relationships permitted between insured depository institutions and hedge funds, private equity funds, and similar entities.

### Reform VIII: Predatory Lending and Consumer Credit Justice

**Immediate Executive Actions:**

Direct the CFPB to issue supervisory guidance reinstating active examination of payday lenders, auto title lenders, and high-cost installment lenders for compliance with the surviving provisions of the Payday Lending Rule, 12 C.F.R. Part 1041. The Trump CFPB's March 2025 announcement that it would not prioritize enforcement of even the rule's surviving payment protection provisions must be immediately reversed.

Direct the CFPB to conduct targeted examinations of credit card issuers with over $10 billion in assets for compliance with CARD Act penalty fee limitations under 15 U.S.C. § 1665d, and to assess whether issuers have implemented fee structures that comply with the statute's "reasonable and proportional" standard.

Direct the CFPB to reinstate active supervision of debt collectors under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq.), with particular attention to medical debt collectors and student loan servicers operating in the non-bank sector.

**Regulatory Restoration:**

Reinstate full enforcement of the Military Lending Act (10 U.S.C. § 987) against financial service providers. The MLA caps interest rates at 36 percent APR for active-duty military members and their dependents. Predatory lenders operating near military bases have historically been among the most aggressive violators, and enforcement must be a CFPB priority.

Reinstate the CFPB's fair lending examination program under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. § 1691 et seq.) and the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3605) to identify and remediate discriminatory lending patterns in mortgage, small business, and consumer lending markets.
