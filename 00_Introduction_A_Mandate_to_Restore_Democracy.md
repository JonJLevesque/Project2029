# Introduction: A Mandate to Restore Democracy

## A Call to Preserve Our Republic

This is not a typical policy document. Project 2029 is an emergency response to an existential threat to American democracy—a comprehensive blueprint for restoring democratic governance after years of systematic assault on our constitutional order.

Project 2025, developed by the Heritage Foundation and over 50 allied organizations, represented an unprecedented plan to dismantle the administrative state, concentrate executive power, politicize the civil service, and transform America into an authoritarian state. What began as a policy wish list became a roadmap for democratic subversion, executed with alarming precision between 2025 and 2029.

We now face the critical task of restoration. Project 2029 provides the framework.

## The Constitutional Crisis We Face

The framers of our Constitution designed a government of separated powers, checks and balances, and rule of law—not rule by one person or party. They understood that democracy requires:

- **Independent institutions** that serve the public, not partisan interests
- **Professional civil servants** selected by merit, not political loyalty
- **Rule of law** where no one is above accountability
- **Free and fair elections** protected from manipulation
- **Separation of powers** preventing concentration of authority
- **Freedom of speech and press** enabling truth to challenge power

Project 2025 systematically attacked each of these foundations. Through Schedule F reclassifications, they purged career civil servants and replaced them with political loyalists. They weaponized the Department of Justice against political opponents while shielding allies from accountability. They undermined the independence of inspectors general, intelligence agencies, and regulatory bodies. They suppressed voting rights, spread election disinformation, and challenged legitimate electoral outcomes.

The damage was profound. But the Constitution endures. And with it, our mandate to restore what was lost.

## Our Five Core Mandates

### 1. Reversal of Project 2025

**Complete and immediate reversal** of Project 2025's regulatory, administrative, and ideological transformations across all federal agencies. This includes:

- Reversing Schedule F and restoring merit-based civil service
- Reinstating fired inspectors general and career professionals
- Rescinding executive orders that concentrated power or undermined institutions
- Reversing regulatory rollbacks that harmed public health, safety, and the environment
- Restoring scientific integrity to government decision-making
- Rebuilding diplomatic relationships damaged by isolationism

This is not about partisan retaliation—it's about institutional restoration. Every Project 2025 policy that weakened democratic governance must be methodically reversed and replaced with reforms that strengthen democratic accountability.

### 2. Strengthening Democracy

**Rebuild democratic norms and civic infrastructure** to ensure government serves the people, not narrow interests. This requires:

- Restoring independence to federal agencies from political interference
- Strengthening inspectors general and whistleblower protections
- Implementing robust ethics standards and conflict-of-interest rules
- Protecting the independence of law enforcement and intelligence agencies
- Ensuring scientific integrity in regulatory decision-making
- Rebuilding trust in democratic institutions through transparency
- Protecting voting rights and electoral integrity
- Strengthening congressional oversight mechanisms

Democracy is not just about elections—it's about the daily functioning of government with integrity, competence, and accountability to the public interest.

### 3. Education for Citizenship

**Major expansion and modernization of the Department of Education** to prioritize the skills democracy requires. In an era of misinformation, foreign propaganda, and democratic backsliding, we must invest heavily in:

- **Civic literacy**: Understanding how government works, constitutional principles, and civic responsibilities
- **Critical thinking**: Evaluating sources, identifying logical fallacies, distinguishing fact from opinion
- **Media literacy**: Recognizing misinformation, understanding algorithmic manipulation, navigating digital information ecosystems
- **Democratic values**: Pluralism, tolerance, civil discourse, respect for rule of law
- **Historical understanding**: Learning from both democracy's triumphs and failures

Education is democracy's immune system. A well-informed citizenry is the ultimate check on authoritarianism. Project 2025 sought to weaken public education and eliminate civics programs. We will do the opposite—making civic education a national priority.

### 4. Justice and Ethical Governance

**Radical reform of the Department of Justice** to ensure it serves justice, not political interests. This includes:

- Complete overhaul of leadership to remove political operatives
- Strengthening institutional safeguards against political interference
- Robust ethics frameworks and enforcement mechanisms
- Restoration of voting rights enforcement and civil rights protections
- Depoliticization of prosecutorial decisions
- Independence for Special Counsels and Inspector General investigations
- Transparency in decision-making processes
- Protection for career prosecutors from political pressure

The Department of Justice must be exactly what its name implies—a department dedicated to justice for all Americans, not a tool for partisan advantage or personal vendettas.

### 5. Accountability for Subversion

**Implement legal accountability** for individuals who participated in or enabled subversion of democracy. This is the most legally complex and constitutionally sensitive mandate, requiring:

- Thorough investigation of potential crimes: seditious conspiracy, obstruction of justice, election interference, abuse of power, ethics violations
- Review of historical precedents for holding officials accountable
- Establishment of Special Counsel investigations with appropriate independence
- Rigorous adherence to due process and constitutional rights
- Non-partisan application of legal standards
- Focus on genuine criminal conduct, not policy disagreements
- Protection of First Amendment rights while addressing unlawful action
- Truth and reconciliation mechanisms alongside prosecutorial accountability

This is not about political revenge—it's about rule of law. Democracy cannot survive if those who attempt to overthrow it face no consequences. But equally, democracy cannot survive if accountability becomes politicized persecution. We must get this balance right.

## The Path Forward: Six Sections

This document is organized into six sections, mirroring Project 2025's structure but inverting its authoritarian vision with a democratic one:

### Section One: Restoring Good Governance (Chapters 1-3)
Restructuring the White House, Executive Office, and civil service to restore ethical governance, transparency, and merit-based administration.

### Section Two: The Common Defense (Chapters 4-9)
Aligning defense, homeland security, diplomacy, and intelligence with democratic values while maintaining strong national security.

### Section Three: The General Welfare (Chapters 10-20)
Rebuilding agencies that serve public welfare—from agriculture and education to justice and veterans affairs—with a focus on restoring their missions and independence.

### Section Four: The Economy (Chapters 21-26)
Ensuring economic policy serves broad prosperity, not narrow interests, through fair taxation, smart regulation, and support for workers and small businesses.

### Section Five: Independent Regulatory Agencies (Chapter 27)
Restoring the independence and effectiveness of financial regulators and other independent agencies.

### Section Six: Safeguarding Democracy and Accountability (Chapters 28-29)
Establishing legal accountability for democratic subversion and implementing structural safeguards to prevent future authoritarian threats.

## Principles Guiding This Work

Every proposal in Project 2029 adheres to these principles:

1. **Constitutional Fidelity**: All reforms are grounded in constitutional law and respect for constitutional limits
2. **Rule of Law**: Accountability for violations of law, protection of lawful conduct
3. **Due Process**: Respect for procedural rights and fair treatment
4. **Non-Partisanship**: Focus on institutional health, not partisan advantage
5. **Transparency**: Open government accountable to the people
6. **Evidence-Based Policy**: Decisions guided by facts, science, and expertise
7. **Institutional Independence**: Agencies serve their missions, not political interests
8. **Democratic Values**: Pluralism, tolerance, equality, and respect for rights

## The Stakes

This moment will define whether American democracy endures or falls to authoritarianism. History will judge how we respond.

We've faced such moments before—after the Civil War, during Reconstruction, after Watergate, and following other constitutional crises. Each time, the American people chose renewal over resignation. Each time, we strengthened our democracy rather than abandoning it.

Now it's our turn.

Project 2029 is more than a policy document. It's a covenant with future generations to preserve the democratic republic we inherited. It's a promise to restore what was damaged, strengthen what remains, and build the safeguards necessary to prevent such an assault from succeeding again.

The work begins now. Democracy demands it. The Constitution requires it. And the American people deserve nothing less.
