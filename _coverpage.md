# Project 2029

## A Mandate for Restorative and Transformative Democratic Renewal

A 210,000+ word progressive policy framework — ready-made for the next Democratic administration. Thirty-one chapters covering every major federal agency, six proposed constitutional amendments, and ninety-plus federal legislative proposals.

**Built as a direct counter to the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.**
