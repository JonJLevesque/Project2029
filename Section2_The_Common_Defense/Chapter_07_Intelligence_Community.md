# Chapter 7: Intelligence Community

## Executive Summary

Project 2025 politicized intelligence, undermined congressional oversight, and weaponized intelligence agencies against domestic political opponents. This chapter establishes reforms for apolitical intelligence analysis, strengthened oversight, strict rule of law adherence, and ensures intelligence is never weaponized against democratic processes.

## The Project 2025 Damage Assessment

### Politicization of Intelligence

- Surveillance of journalists and protesters
- No-knock raids for political purposes
- Leaked classified information selectively
- Whistleblower retaliation

### Oversight Evasion

- Inspector General access denied
- Whistleblower channels blocked
- FISA Court misled

## Immediate Reversal Actions (Days 1-100)
