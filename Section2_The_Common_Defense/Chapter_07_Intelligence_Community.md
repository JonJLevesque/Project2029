# Chapter 7: Intelligence Community

## Executive Summary

The United States Intelligence Community (IC) comprises seventeen federal agencies and organizations
responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence to protect national security.
These agencies — led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Intelligence Agency
(DIA), and thirteen other components — exist to provide objective, apolitical analysis to
policymakers, protect the nation from foreign threats, and operate under the constitutional and
statutory framework established by Congress to prevent abuse of their extraordinary powers. The IC's
independence from political control is not a bureaucratic preference; it is the foundational
principle that makes intelligence useful. Analysis cooked to confirm political conclusions is not
intelligence — it is propaganda.

The Trump administration, through DNI Tulsi Gabbard and in alignment with the Project 2025 blueprint
for dismantling the administrative state, has executed a systematic assault on the Intelligence
Community's independence, institutional knowledge, and professional integrity. Beginning in February
2025, Gabbard moved to purge career analysts, revoke the security clearances of officials who
reached conclusions politically inconvenient to the administration, cancel long-standing intelligence
products that contradicted administration narratives, hollow out the ODNI by more than 40 percent,
and impose loyalty tests on incoming IC personnel. The CIA initiated layoffs of approximately 1,200
positions. The IC's most senior Russia analyst — an officer with more than two decades of service —
was fired within months. The Global Trends report, a once-quadrennial product published since 1997
that provides long-range strategic assessment of global threats, was cancelled. Climate change was
stripped from the Annual Threat Assessment for the first time in over a decade. The Five Eyes
intelligence-sharing alliance, the cornerstone of Western signals cooperation, was fractured by the
administration's mishandling of classified material and its decision to classify Ukraine war analysis
as NOFORN, cutting off allied partners. These actions have degraded the United States' intelligence
capabilities at the precise moment when adversaries are most active and capable.

The next Democratic administration will inherit an IC that has been politically penetrated,
institutionally hollowed, and internationally isolated. This chapter establishes the comprehensive
framework for restoring IC independence, rebuilding institutional capacity and analytic integrity,
strengthening oversight mechanisms, protecting whistleblowers, reforming FISA surveillance
authorities, and re-establishing the United States as a trusted intelligence partner to its allies.

**The Stakes**: The degradation of the Intelligence Community is not an abstract governance failure
— it is a national security emergency. An IC staffed by loyalty, not competence, will fail to
anticipate adversary moves. An IC whose analysts self-censor to avoid retaliation will produce
sanitized assessments that mislead policymakers. An IC cut off from allied intelligence sharing will
have blind spots adversaries will exploit. History's most catastrophic intelligence failures —
Pearl Harbor, 9/11, the failure to anticipate the Soviet nuclear program's pace — were failures of
analysis, not collection. Project 2025 has engineered the preconditions for the next catastrophic
failure.

**Key Reforms**:
- Restore DNI independence through statutory insulation from political removal without cause and
  fixed terms
- Reinstate all career intelligence officials purged for politically motivated reasons and conduct
  a comprehensive review of all security clearance revocations since January 20, 2025
- Reconstruct and fully fund the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General and restore
  the Whistleblowing and Source Protection Program
- Reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) with mandatory amicus curiae, enhanced
  accuracy verification, and expanded transparency reporting
- Restore the Global Trends strategic assessment program and recommit to comprehensive Annual Threat
  Assessments that include climate security, election interference, and the full spectrum of
  national security threats
- Rebuild Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationships through binding commitments to classified
  information security and responsible intelligence-sharing protocols
- Prohibit loyalty tests for IC hiring and assignment; restore Schedule F exclusion for career
  intelligence professionals
- Establish a statutory Intelligence Community Civil Liberties and Privacy Board with subpoena
  authority
- Codify protections for IC whistleblowers with multiple protected channels, anti-retaliation
  enforcement, and legal fee indemnification
- Prohibit the weaponization of security clearance revocation as a punitive tool against officials
  whose professional conclusions are politically inconvenient
- Reconstitute the National Counterintelligence and Security Center and conduct a full damage
  assessment of foreign penetration during the disruption period

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. §§ 3001 et seq.);
Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (50 U.S.C. § 3001 note, Pub. L. 108-458);
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. §§ 1801 et seq.); Central Intelligence
Agency Act of 1949 (50 U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq.); Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.);
Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (50 U.S.C. § 3033 note); Executive
Order 12333 (United States Intelligence Activities, as amended); Article II, Section 2
(Commander-in-Chief clause); Article I, Section 8 (congressional authority over the armed forces
and appropriations); Fourth Amendment (protection against unreasonable searches and seizures).

## Part I: Project 2025 Intelligence Community Damage and Destruction

### Damage Area 1: The Politicization of the Directorate of National Intelligence

Project 2025 explicitly called for subjecting the IC to presidential control, characterizing
independent career analysts as an entrenched "deep state" hostile to democratic accountability.
The Heritage Foundation's blueprint targeted the ODNI specifically, calling for its reorganization
to ensure that intelligence analysis conformed to administration foreign policy preferences rather
than remaining independent of them. This was not a proposal to improve intelligence quality — it was
a proposal to ensure intelligence never contradicted the President.

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Tulsi Gabbard was confirmed as the 8th Director of National Intelligence on February 12, 2025,
despite having no intelligence background and a prior record of positions substantially aligned with
foreign adversary narratives on Syria, Russia, and other sensitive intelligence matters. Her
appointment was itself a declaration that the DNI's role had been redefined: from managing the IC's
analytic independence to ensuring the IC's institutional loyalty to the executive.

Gabbard's first major institutional action was the establishment of the Director's Initiatives Group
(DIG), a task force nominally chartered to investigate "weaponization" of the IC. In practice, the
DIG functioned as a loyalty and political review body. Democratic lawmakers, including
Representatives Lofgren and Raskin, formally demanded answers about the DIG's activities after
reporting revealed it was focused on identifying analysts who had previously reached conclusions
contrary to Trump's stated positions, including on the 2016 Russian election interference
assessment.

Gabbard then announced ODNI 2.0, a restructuring plan that reduced the ODNI by more than 40 percent
and claimed projected savings of over $700 million annually. The cuts were not strategic
consolidations guided by capability review — they were ideologically motivated reductions that
eliminated experienced analytic capacity, coordination functions, and the institutional
infrastructure for independent assessment. The offices eliminated were disproportionately those
responsible for long-range strategic analysis, civil liberties review, and the production of
assessments that had historically contradicted administration narratives.

Gabbard used the ODNI platform to amplify disputed claims that the Obama administration "manufactured
and politicized intelligence" regarding 2016 Russian election interference — a claim not supported
by the professional IC assessment or the work of the Senate Intelligence Committee's bipartisan
investigation. This represented a fundamental perversion of the DNI's role: rather than managing
the delivery of objective intelligence to policymakers, Gabbard used the position to attack the
institutional credibility of the assessments that career professionals had produced.

The 2025 Annual Threat Assessment, delivered to Congress in March 2025, was the first such
assessment in over a decade to omit any reference to climate change as a national security threat.
That omission reflected political preference, not professional intelligence judgment. The IC's own
analytic community had included climate security in threat assessments since 2008, reflecting
established scientific consensus and documented links between climate instability and conflict, mass
migration, and threats to U.S. military installations worldwide.

In September 2025, Gabbard eliminated the Global Trends strategic assessment program, cancelling
the 2025 report and shuttering the office responsible for its production. The Global Trends series
had been published quadrennially since 1997, providing unclassified long-range assessments of
geopolitical, demographic, technological, and environmental trends that informed policymakers,
researchers, and the public. Gabbard justified the cancellation by claiming a draft of the 2025
report "violated professional analytic tradecraft standards" — a characterization former senior
officials rejected as a pretext for suppressing analysis that contradicted administration priorities.

### Damage Area 2: The Systematic Purge of Career Intelligence Professionals

The Project 2025 framework explicitly endorsed extending Schedule F — the reclassification of career
civil servants as at-will employees — to the intelligence community. By stripping IC professionals
of civil service protections, the administration could terminate analysts and officers whose
assessments were professionally sound but politically inconvenient, replacing them with personnel
selected for political loyalty rather than analytic competence.

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Beginning in early 2025, the CIA initiated layoffs affecting approximately 1,200 positions — one of
the largest personnel reductions in the agency's history. These cuts were not driven by mission
redundancy analysis or efficiency review. They were driven by the administration's hostility to a
career workforce it viewed as institutionally resistant to political direction.

In August 2025, the Trump administration purged dozens of senior intelligence officials in a single
week. Among the most significant casualties was the CIA's senior Russia and Eurasia analyst — an
officer with more than 20 years of service who had coordinated the IC's assessment of Russian
election interference in 2016. Her removal, along with the dismissals of Shelby Pierson and Vinh
Nguyen, represented the elimination of some of the IC's most experienced senior career professionals.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth simultaneously fired the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency
and two senior military commanders, extending the political purge into defense intelligence.

The administration implemented loyalty screening for IC hiring that had nothing to do with genuine
security adjudication. Candidates for intelligence positions were required to answer questions
including: Was January 6 "an inside job?" Was the 2020 presidential election "stolen?" These
politically charged questions assessed political loyalty, not analytic competence, security
reliability, or suitability for intelligence positions. The administration also reviewed social media
posts and past political donations as screening criteria, creating a de facto ideological test for
employment in the IC that is antithetical to the principle of apolitical professional intelligence.

Gabbard's ODNI 2.0 cut the ODNI's own workforce by over 40 percent. The officers, analysts, and
staff eliminated in these cuts represented decades of institutional knowledge — tradecraft, source
relationships, analytical frameworks, and understanding of adversary behavior that cannot be
reconstituted quickly or cheaply. The loss of this institutional memory creates lasting gaps in
American intelligence capability that adversaries will exploit for years.

### Damage Area 3: Weaponization of Security Clearance Revocations

Security clearances exist to protect classified information. The clearance adjudication process
assesses whether an individual poses a risk of unauthorized disclosure or foreign compromise. It is
not — and has never historically been — a mechanism for punishing officials whose professional
judgments are politically inconvenient. The Trump administration converted this process into a
political weapon on an unprecedented scale.

**What Project 2025 Did:**

On his first day in office, Trump announced the revocation of clearances for more than four dozen
former intelligence officials who had signed a 2020 letter noting that the Hunter Biden laptop story
bore hallmarks of Russian information operations. This assessment was consistent with established
Russian influence operation tradecraft, and the officials were professionally qualified to make it.
Their clearances were revoked as punishment for reaching that conclusion.

In August 2025, DNI Gabbard revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former national
security officials, accusing them of "politicizing and manipulating intelligence, leaking classified
intelligence without authorization, and/or committing intentional egregious violations of tradecraft
standards." The announcement provided no evidence to support any of these accusations. Several of
the individuals targeted had worked on the 2016 Russian election interference assessment. Others had
signed a 2019 letter expressing concerns about Ukraine policy.

The breadth and nakedly political character of these revocations was, according to national security
law experts, without precedent in American history. No president had previously used the clearance
revocation process so publicly and on such a scale as a punitive mechanism against officials who had
legally and professionally done their jobs.

The chilling effect on intelligence analysis may be more damaging than the individual revocations
themselves. An IC where analysts know that professionally sound but politically inconvenient
conclusions can cost them their careers will self-censor. That self-censorship produces the very
"cooked" intelligence that constitutes the worst failure mode in the history of American
intelligence. An IC that tells Presidents what they want to hear is not protecting national security
— it is enabling the delusion that leads to catastrophic strategic surprise.

### Damage Area 4: Destruction of IC Oversight Infrastructure

The IC Inspector General system was established by the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.)
and extended to the Intelligence Community through the Intelligence Community Whistleblower
Protection Act of 1998 (50 U.S.C. § 3033 note) and subsequent legislation. The IC IG and component
IGs serve as the internal accountability mechanisms — the institutions that identify waste, fraud,
abuse, and legal violations within the IC before they become existential scandals or operational
failures.

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The administration attacked the IC IG infrastructure through personnel actions and institutional
undermining. Dan Meyer, who led the Whistleblowing and Source Protection Program at the Office of
the Intelligence Community Inspector General, was terminated in October 2025. Meyer's dismissal
occurred through a process that Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Wyden described in a bipartisan
letter as "marked by procedural irregularities and serious conflicts of interest." The acting ODNI
leadership demonstrated, according to the Senators, "a lack of support for the critical whistleblower
protection mission of the office."

Meyer's termination left the IC's primary whistleblower protection infrastructure headless at
precisely the moment when the IC workforce most needed assurance that protected disclosures would be
received and investigated rather than punished. The Project on Government Oversight documented the
resulting "oversight crisis" — an IC in which whistleblowers had every reason to fear retaliation
and no confidence that institutional channels would protect them.

An internal review by the IC IG itself found widespread problems with how component IGs handled
whistleblower reprisal complaints. That review was suppressed after leadership discovered that one
of the investigators working on it was a CIA whistleblower who was already suing the agency for
retaliating against him. This incident encapsulates the institutional pathology: the mechanism
designed to identify retaliation against whistleblowers was itself infected by retaliation against
the whistleblower conducting the review.

### Damage Area 5: Domestic Weaponization of Intelligence Capabilities

A distinct category of Project 2025 damage involves the use — or credible threat of use — of
intelligence capabilities against the administration's domestic political opponents. This is not a
new threat; the Church Committee investigations of 1975-1976 documented systematic FBI and CIA
operations targeting civil rights leaders, antiwar activists, and political figures from the 1950s
through the 1970s. COINTELPRO and Operation CHAOS represented precisely the kind of domestic
weaponization that the post-Church Committee statutory and regulatory framework was designed to
prevent permanently.

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 explicitly proposed using the FBI and the IC to investigate domestic political
adversaries under the guise of counterterrorism and counterintelligence. The document characterized
political opponents as existential threats warranting the full attention of the security apparatus
— a characterization that, when acted upon, constitutes the weaponization of law enforcement and
intelligence against democratic opposition.

The DIG established by DNI Gabbard was used to investigate and identify IC personnel based on their
past professional conclusions — specifically, their work on Russian election interference. This is
domestic political surveillance of federal employees based on the content of their professional
work. The creation of a "whistleblower hotline" at the ODNI — announced early in the Gabbard
tenure — was reported by IC professionals to function as a mechanism for reporting colleagues who
expressed dissenting views rather than a genuine channel for reporting waste, fraud, or abuse.

The classification of Ukraine war analysis as NOFORN had the practical effect of preventing American
allies from assessing whether the United States' intelligence on the conflict was being shaped by
the administration's political objectives. The combination of that classification decision with the
simultaneous dismantling of election security programs created conditions where foreign influence
operations could operate with reduced scrutiny at the precise moment when U.S. elections were
approaching.

Executive Order 12333 prohibits the IC from engaging in collection against U.S. persons except as
authorized by statute. Any IC collection activity targeting domestic political opponents without
FISA Court authorization or other statutory sanction violates both Executive Order 12333 and the
Fourth Amendment. The IC Personnel Review Board established by this chapter will have specific
authority to investigate any such activities that occurred during the Trump administration.

### Damage Area 6: Destruction of Allied Intelligence-Sharing Relationships

The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partnership — among the United States, United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand — is the foundational framework for Western signals intelligence
cooperation. Established during World War II and formalized through the UKUSA Agreement of 1946,
Five Eyes represents the most comprehensive intelligence-sharing arrangement in the world, providing
collective capabilities that substantially exceed the sum of any member's individual capacity.

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The administration's handling of classified information critically damaged allied confidence in the
United States as a reliable intelligence partner. The exposure of classified signal chat
communications involving senior administration officials discussing military options in Yemen —
disclosed in the "Signalgate" episode — demonstrated to allied partners that the Trump
administration treated classified information with institutional recklessness that no responsible
intelligence partner can accept.

DNI Gabbard's July 2025 directive classifying all IC analysis and information related to Russia-
Ukraine peace negotiations as NOFORN — meaning no foreign dissemination — cut allied partners off
from intelligence they had historically received and that was directly relevant to their own security
decisions. This unilateral withdrawal from established intelligence-sharing practice left Five Eyes
partners to draw their own conclusions from their own collection, undermining the collaborative
analysis that makes the alliance strategically valuable.

British and Canadian officials reported that their governments were reconsidering what intelligence
they shared with the United States, concerned that classified information disclosed to American
partners might be mishandled, selectively weaponized, or shared with adversaries. This erosion of
allied intelligence confidence represents a strategic setback whose consequences will persist long
after the Trump administration ends. Rebuilding the trust of allied intelligence partners requires
years of demonstrated responsible behavior; it cannot be reconstituted by announcement.

### The Human Cost

The cumulative human cost of Project 2025's IC damage is documented and severe. Approximately 1,200
CIA positions were eliminated through layoffs, representing decades of combined analytic and
operational experience. Dozens of senior officials — including career professionals with 20 or more
years of service — were fired or had their clearances revoked without documented cause. The ODNI
workforce was reduced by more than 40 percent. The IC's most experienced Russia analysts, election
security specialists, and strategic assessment professionals were specifically targeted for
elimination.

The professional damage extends beyond those directly dismissed. Thousands of remaining IC
professionals operate under the understanding that producing politically inconvenient conclusions is
a career-ending risk. This chilling effect corrupts the entire analytic process. An IC operating
under political fear does not produce intelligence — it produces confirmation of what policymakers
already believe. The United States is now less prepared for strategic surprise than at any point
since the failures that preceded the September 11, 2001 attacks.

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

Article II, Section 2 designates the President as Commander-in-Chief, providing the executive branch
with inherent authority over national security functions including intelligence. However, this
authority is not unlimited. The Supreme Court has consistently held that executive authority must be
exercised within the framework of law established by Congress, particularly where civil liberties
and individual rights are implicated. *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952),
established the tripartite framework for analyzing executive power, recognizing that where the
President acts contrary to congressional statute, his authority is at its lowest ebb.

Article I, Section 8 grants Congress plenary authority over appropriations and the organization of
the armed forces. Intelligence agencies are creatures of statute — they exist because Congress
created them and funds them. Congressional oversight of the IC is not a courtesy; it is a
constitutional requirement grounded in Congress's power to appropriate funds, conduct
investigations, and legislate the structure of executive agencies.

The Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures constrains IC
surveillance authorities domestically. While the IC's foreign intelligence collection does not
directly implicate Fourth Amendment rights of foreign nationals abroad, the collection of
information about U.S. persons is subject to Fourth Amendment analysis. FISA's statutory framework
represents Congress's attempt to establish a lawful, court-supervised process for foreign
intelligence surveillance that respects Fourth Amendment values.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. §§ 3001 et seq.):** The foundational statute
establishing the modern IC, including the CIA and the National Security Council. Subsequent
amendments established the position of Director of National Intelligence. The Act provides the
structural framework within which the IC operates and charges it with collecting and analyzing
intelligence for national security purposes.

**Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Pub. L. 108-458; 50 U.S.C. § 3001
note):** Established the Director of National Intelligence as the head of the IC, created the
ODNI, and established the National Counterterrorism Center. The Act was the post-9/11 reform
legislation designed to correct the coordination failures that contributed to the September 11
intelligence failure.

**Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. §§ 1801 et seq.):** Established the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and the procedures for court-authorized electronic
surveillance, physical searches, and other collection activities targeting foreign powers and their
agents. Section 702 of FISA (added by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008) authorizes the collection
of communications of foreign targets outside the United States, including incidental collection of
communications with U.S. persons.

**Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 (50 U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq.):** Establishes the
statutory framework for CIA operations and authorities, including the Director's responsibility for
protecting intelligence sources and methods.

**Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.):** Establishes the Inspector General system
across the federal government, including independence requirements and direct reporting to Congress.
The IC IG was established pursuant to this Act and subsequent IC-specific legislation.

**Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (50 U.S.C. § 3033 note):**
Establishes protected channels for IC employees to make disclosures of urgent concerns to
congressional intelligence committees, including protections against retaliation for making such
disclosures.

**Executive Order 12333 (United States Intelligence Activities, as amended):** The foundational
executive order governing IC authorities, including the prohibition on assassination, the prohibition
on IC collection against U.S. persons except as authorized by law, and the requirement that IC
activities be conducted consistent with applicable law.

### The Analytic Integrity Legal Framework

The principle of analytic independence — the requirement that intelligence assessments reflect the
professional judgment of career analysts rather than political direction from policymakers — is not
merely a professional norm. It is embedded in the statutory framework of the IC. The National
Security Act charges the Director of National Intelligence with ensuring that IC analysis is
"objective" and "independent of political considerations." (50 U.S.C. § 3024(b)). The DNI's
statutory responsibility to provide "accurate and timely" intelligence to policymakers
(50 U.S.C. § 3024(a)) is incompatible with the direction of analysis toward politically
predetermined conclusions.

The dismissal of career intelligence professionals for producing legally and professionally sound
assessments that contradict administration preferences may constitute prohibited personnel practices
under 5 U.S.C. §§ 2302(b)(8) and (9), which protect federal employees from retaliation for
protected disclosures and the exercise of protected rights. Security clearance revocations used as
punitive mechanisms rather than genuine security determinations may violate procedural due process
protections recognized in *Department of the Navy v. Egan*, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), and subsequent
circuit court decisions interpreting the scope of executive authority over clearances within
constitutional constraints.

The mass security clearance revocations conducted by DNI Gabbard in August 2025 — targeting 37
officials without documented cause or evidence — present a specific legal question regarding whether
the Executive Branch may use the clearance revocation power in a programmatic, punitive manner
designed to suppress professional speech rather than to address genuine security concerns. *Egan*
holds that courts generally should not second-guess security clearance determinations, recognizing
the Executive's constitutional primacy in national security. However, subsequent decisions have
recognized that Egan deference has limits where clearance actions are taken to retaliate against
protected First Amendment activity or whistleblowing. The IC Personnel Review Board established by
this chapter will apply these legal standards rigorously.

### The Congressional Oversight Framework

Congress's authority over the Intelligence Community is comprehensive and constitutionally grounded.
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) was established in 1976 following the Church
Committee investigations, which revealed systematic IC abuses including assassination plots, illegal
domestic surveillance, and covert operations conducted without congressional knowledge. COINTELPRO,
Operation CHAOS, and the CIA's domestic mail-opening program were among the abuses that the Church
Committee exposed. The HPSCI was established in 1977. Together, these committees exercise authority
over IC appropriations, confirm senior IC officials, receive mandatory notifications of covert
actions under 50 U.S.C. § 3093, and conduct oversight investigations.

The Trump administration systematically degraded congressional oversight. Gang of Eight
notifications — required by 50 U.S.C. § 3093 for particularly sensitive covert actions — were
delayed, incomplete, or withheld. The SSCI and HPSCI were denied timely access to intelligence
relevant to their oversight functions. IC officials who cooperated fully with congressional inquiries
faced adverse personnel actions.

The next administration will restore a culture of compliance with congressional oversight
requirements. Executive Order 13526 on classified national security information will be amended to
specifically prohibit classification decisions made for the purpose of withholding information from
congressional oversight committees with appropriate jurisdiction. Any IC official who delays or
withholds required congressional notification will face disciplinary action. The DNI will be
required to provide the SSCI and HPSCI with quarterly certifications of compliance with all
statutory notification requirements.

---

## Part III: Comprehensive Intelligence Community Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: Restore DNI Independence and Statutory Insulation

The Director of National Intelligence must be structurally insulated from political pressure. The
current statute provides no fixed term and no cause requirement for removal — a structural
vulnerability that Project 2025 exploited. The next administration will act immediately to correct
this structural defect.

Issue Executive Order establishing a binding policy that the DNI serves a statutory term of six
years, renewable once, and may be removed by the President only for cause — specifically, for
documented abuse of authority, violation of law, or demonstrated failure to perform statutory
duties. Submit legislation to Congress codifying this removal protection, modeled on the statutory
protections for Federal Reserve Board members and FISA Court judges.

Amend the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (50 U.S.C. § 3023) to require that any
removal of the DNI be accompanied by a written statement of cause transmitted to the congressional
intelligence committees, with a 30-day congressional review period before removal takes effect.
This provision, modeled on the Inspector General Independence Act of 2022, will create structural
friction against politically motivated removals without eliminating the President's ultimate
authority over senior executive officials.

Establish a DNI Qualifications Review Board, comprising the chairs and ranking members of the SSCI
and HPSCI, to review and opine on nominees' analytic qualifications. While the Senate's
confirmation power is the ultimate constitutional check, the Qualifications Review Board will
establish a public record of whether nominees meet the professional standards the position requires.
Nominees with no intelligence background and a documented record of positions aligned with foreign
adversary narratives will face public scrutiny that the confirmation process alone cannot provide.

The ODNI will be rebuilt to its pre-2025 staffing levels. The ODNI 2.0 reductions will be reviewed
and reversed where they eliminated core analytic, oversight, and coordination functions. Every
eliminated position will be audited against the ODNI's statutory missions under the Intelligence
Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, and positions essential to those missions will be restored.
The Civil Liberties Protection Office (50 U.S.C. § 3029), the Science and Technology Directorate,
and the National Intelligence Council will be reconstituted at full operational capacity.

### Reform II: Restore Analytic Integrity Across the Intelligence Community

The fundamental product of the Intelligence Community is objective, evidence-based analysis. That
product was systematically corrupted by political direction during the Trump administration.
Restoring it requires both structural reforms and cultural reinvestment in the professional norms
that make intelligence analysis reliable.

Issue Executive Order establishing the National Intelligence Analytic Standards, codifying the
requirement that IC assessments reflect the professional judgment of career analysts based on
available evidence, without political direction from policymakers or political appointees. The Order
will specifically prohibit any political appointee from directing or materially altering any
intelligence assessment. The prohibition will be enforced through the IC IG, which will have
authority to investigate alleged violations and recommend appropriate personnel actions, up to and
including referral for prosecution under applicable law.

Reinstate the Global Trends strategic assessment program. The quadrennial Global Trends series,
cancelled by Gabbard in September 2025, will be reconstituted at the National Intelligence Council.
The 2025 report will be completed based on the professional analytic work already conducted, and
the NIC will resume production of this assessment on the established quadrennial cycle. Attempts to
suppress the assessment's findings for political reasons will be treated as violations of the
analytic standards established by executive order and subject to referral to the IC IG.

Restore comprehensive Annual Threat Assessments covering the full spectrum of national security
threats. The annual unclassified Worldwide Threat Assessment delivered to Congress will reflect the
full professional judgment of the IC, including climate security, election interference, foreign
influence operations, cyberattacks, nuclear proliferation, and the full range of adversary
capabilities. Political appointees may not require the omission of threat categories based on
political preference. The SSCI and HPSCI will receive a classified supplement detailing any cases
where analytic conclusions were altered from the draft prepared by career analysts.

Establish the Senior Analysts' Dissent Channel as a statutory mechanism. The existing informal
dissent mechanisms within the IC — the ability of analysts to submit minority views and footnotes
to assessments — will be codified by statute and strengthened. No career analyst may face adverse
personnel action for submitting a dissenting assessment through proper channels. Dissents and
alternative analyses will be preserved in the analytic record and transmitted to the congressional
intelligence committees along with consensus assessments.

Restore climate security to the Annual Threat Assessment and direct the NIC to reinstate the
Intelligence Community's climate and environmental threat assessment program, coordinating with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Environmental
Protection Agency. Climate change is a documented force multiplier for existing national security
threats — it drives conflict, mass migration, and threats to U.S. military installations worldwide.
Its excision from threat assessment products reflects political censorship, not analytic judgment.

### Reform III: Reinstate Purged Officials and Conduct Security Clearance Review

The administration's politically motivated dismissals and security clearance revocations must be
systematically reviewed and corrected where appropriate. This is not a partisan exercise — it is a
national security imperative. The institutional knowledge lost through political purges cannot be
rapidly reconstituted, and every day that experienced intelligence officers remain excluded from
service is a day that American intelligence capability is diminished.

Within the first 30 days, issue an Executive Order directing the DNI, the Director of CIA, the
Director of DIA, and the heads of all IC components to conduct a comprehensive review of all
personnel separations, forced retirements, and security clearance revocations that occurred on or
after January 20, 2025. The review will assess whether any such action was taken based on: the
professional content of intelligence assessments produced by the affected individual; the
individual's exercise of protected whistleblower activities; the individual's political affiliations,
campaign donations, or social media posts; or other impermissible bases.

Where the review identifies improper personnel actions, the affected individuals will be offered
reinstatement with full back pay, restoration of security clearances, and restoration of appropriate
service credit for retirement purposes. Those who elect not to return to service will be offered
enhanced retirement benefits reflecting the illegal character of their dismissal.

Establish the IC Personnel Review Board, comprising the IC IG, the DNI's Civil Liberties Protection
Officer, and independent national security law experts appointed by the SSCI and HPSCI, to conduct
ongoing review of personnel actions for compliance with the merit system, civil service protections,
and the prohibition on politically motivated personnel actions. The Board will have authority to
recommend corrective actions and to refer cases of willful misconduct to the Department of Justice.

Issue Executive Order prohibiting the use of security clearance revocation as a punitive mechanism.
Security clearance adjudications must be based solely on the criteria established in Security
Executive Agent Directive 4 and its implementing guidelines — criteria that assess genuine security
risk, not professional disagreement with political appointees. Any revocation recommended on
impermissible grounds will be voidable upon review by the IC Personnel Review Board. Career
officials whose clearances were revoked on demonstrably political bases will have their clearances
restored pending full adjudication under proper standards.

### Reform IV: Rebuild the IC Oversight and Whistleblower Protection Infrastructure

Effective oversight of the Intelligence Community requires independent Inspectors General,
functioning whistleblower channels, and congressional committees with meaningful access to IC
activities. Without these structural mechanisms, the IC operates without accountability, and history
demonstrates conclusively what an unaccountable IC produces: COINTELPRO, Operation CHAOS,
MHCHAOS, the Church Committee abuses. The oversight infrastructure is not bureaucratic overhead —
it is the institutional immune system of American democracy.

The IC Inspector General position will be filled immediately with a career national security
professional of unquestioned independence. The Whistleblowing and Source Protection Program, whose
director Dan Meyer was terminated in October 2025, will be reconstituted at full staffing and
provided with a clear mandate, operating procedures, and authority to investigate whistleblower
retaliation complaints across all IC components. The reconstituted Program will have direct access
to the SSCI and HPSCI without requiring ODNI leadership approval.

Submit the IC Inspector General Protection Act to Congress, modeled on the Inspector General
Independence Act of 2022 but specifically tailored to the IC context. The Act will require 30-day
advance notice to Congress before any IC IG can be removed; require the President to transmit
written cause for any removal; prohibit removal of an IC IG based on the content of any report or
referral made to Congress; and provide for the IC IG's independent legal representation before
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

The IC IG's internal review of component IG handling of whistleblower reprisal complaints —
suppressed by the Trump administration — will be completed and transmitted to the SSCI and HPSCI.
The documented finding that the review was quashed after the discovery that one of its investigators
was a CIA whistleblower suing the agency for retaliation will itself be investigated by the
reconstituted IC IG as a potential violation of 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(9).

Codify multiple protected channels for IC whistleblowers. Under 50 U.S.C. § 3033 note, IC
employees may make protected disclosures to the IC IG and to the congressional intelligence
committees. These protections will be expanded to cover disclosures to any member of Congress with
appropriate security clearance, to the Department of Justice Inspector General, and to the Office
of Special Counsel. Anti-retaliation protections will be strengthened, and any adverse personnel
action taken against an IC employee within 24 months of a protected disclosure will be presumed
retaliatory, subject to rebuttal by clear and convincing evidence.

Establish legal fee indemnification for IC whistleblowers who prevail in retaliation claims. The
cost of litigating retaliation claims against the federal government effectively deters meritorious
disclosures. An IC professional who reports genuine waste, fraud, or abuse should not face financial
ruin for having done so. The IC's institutional interest in identifying misconduct exceeds the cost
of supporting those who identify it.

### Reform V: FISA Court Reform and Surveillance Oversight

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the judicial mechanism that authorizes electronic
surveillance, physical searches, and other intelligence collection activities targeting foreign
powers and their agents. Its effectiveness as a check on executive overreach depends on its
independence, the accuracy of representations made before it, and the adversarial testing of
government applications. The FISC has been a source of significant controversy: the DOJ IG's 2019
review of the Crossfire Hurricane FISA applications found seventeen significant errors and
omissions, demonstrating that the accuracy of FISA applications cannot be taken on faith.

Issue Executive Order directing the Attorney General to conduct a comprehensive review of all FISA
applications submitted since January 20, 2025, for compliance with the accuracy requirements
established by the Woods Procedures and subsequent DOJ policy. Any application found to contain
material misstatements will be reported to the FISC and to the SSCI and HPSCI, with copies
preserved in the IC accountability record.

Submit the FISA Court Reform and Transparency Act to Congress with the following provisions:

**Mandatory amicus curiae**: An independent advocate with appropriate security clearance must be
appointed for every Title I FISA application targeting a U.S. person or involving a U.S. person's
communications collected under Section 702. The amicus will have full access to all relevant
classified information and will present the privacy interests of the target before the court. This
requirement will be non-waivable; the FISC will not accept applications without a designated
amicus.

**Accuracy verification**: The Department of Justice's National Security Division must certify in
writing that the factual representations in every FISA application have been independently verified
against primary source materials before submission to the FISC. The Woods Procedures will be
codified by statute rather than maintained as internal policy subject to executive modification.
Knowing misrepresentation in a FISA application will carry criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1001 in addition to existing contempt sanctions.

**Annual transparency reports**: The FISC will publish annual reports disclosing the total number
of applications received, approved, modified, and denied; the total number of U.S. persons
subjected to Section 702 collection; and the number of backdoor searches — queries of Section 702
data using U.S. person identifiers — conducted by each IC component.

**Warrant requirement for backdoor searches**: Any query of Section 702-collected data using a
U.S. person identifier must be authorized by a FISC warrant based on probable cause, except in
emergency circumstances subject to post-hoc judicial review within 72 hours.

Section 702 of FISA, which authorizes collection of communications of foreign targets including
incidental collection of U.S. person communications, will be reauthorized with strengthened
minimization procedures, enhanced oversight of the FBI's domestic use of 702-collected data, and a
sunset provision requiring reauthorization every four years to ensure ongoing congressional review.

### Reform VI: Rebuild Five Eyes and Allied Intelligence Relationships

The intelligence-sharing relationships the United States has built over 80 years are strategic
assets of incalculable value. Their degradation under the Trump administration has left the United
States with analytical blind spots that adversaries will exploit. Rebuilding these relationships
requires demonstrated behavioral change, not merely stated commitments.

Within the first 100 days, the President will direct the DNI and the Director of CIA to conduct
joint visits with the heads of the UK MI6, GCHQ, the Canadian CSIS, the Australian ASIS and ASD,
and the New Zealand GCSB to assess the current state of intelligence sharing, identify programs
that have been disrupted, and establish a joint working group to restore information-sharing
protocols to pre-2025 levels. These visits will be substantive operational engagements, not
ceremonial reassurances.

Revoke the July 2025 Gabbard directive that classified all Russia-Ukraine analysis as NOFORN.
Intelligence related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict is directly relevant to the security of allied
partners and requires collaborative analysis. The NOFORN designation will be replaced with
intelligence-sharing agreements appropriate to the sensitivity of specific materials, developed in
consultation with affected allied partners.

Establish the Allied Intelligence Partnership Protection Act, directing the DNI to develop binding
internal protocols for the handling and protection of intelligence received from Five Eyes partners,
including standards for storage, access limitations, incident reporting, and notification
requirements. Any unauthorized disclosure of allied-sourced intelligence will be subject to enhanced
criminal penalties under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act (50 U.S.C. §§ 3121 et seq.)
and the Espionage Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 793 et seq.).

Expand intelligence-sharing arrangements beyond Five Eyes to include deeper collaboration with NATO
partners on hybrid warfare, foreign influence operations, and cybersecurity intelligence. Establish
a standing NATO Intelligence Integration Committee under the umbrella of the NATO Intelligence
Fusion Centre to coordinate analysis of adversary behavior across member states.

### Reform VII: Counter Foreign Influence Operations and Defend Democratic Processes

The foreign influence operations conducted by Russia, China, Iran, and other adversaries against
American democratic processes represent one of the most urgent and underappreciated threats to
national security. The Trump administration suppressed IC work on election security and foreign
influence, eliminating the IC Election Security Initiative and discouraging analysis of foreign
threats that might complicate the administration's political messaging.

Reconstitute the Intelligence Community Election Security Initiative and direct the DNI, in
coordination with the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), to
produce comprehensive assessments of foreign influence operations targeting U.S. elections. These
assessments will be provided to election officials at the federal, state, and local levels, with
cleared briefings for election administrators in all 50 states before each federal election cycle.

Issue Executive Order directing the DNI to establish a Foreign Malign Influence Center with
dedicated analytic capacity, mission management, and interagency coordination authority. The Center
will consolidate IC work on foreign influence operations, coordinate with the Department of State's
Global Engagement Center, and produce regular classified and unclassified assessments for
congressional oversight and, where appropriate, public release.

Direct the FBI Director to restore the Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF) to full operating
capacity and ensure that the FITF has clear predication standards, proper oversight by the FISA
Court where applicable, and direct reporting lines to the congressional intelligence committees for
activities involving U.S. persons.

Issue a formal National Security Presidential Memorandum designating election infrastructure as
critical infrastructure under Presidential Policy Directive 21, and direct the IC to treat foreign
interference with election systems as an act meriting the full range of authorized responses, up to
and including sanctions and offensive cyber operations pursuant to Presidential Policy Directive 20.

### Reform VIII: Strengthen Counterintelligence Against Foreign Penetration

While Project 2025 and the Trump administration attacked the IC from within, the external threat
from foreign intelligence services has not paused. Russia's SVR, FSB, and GRU; China's Ministry
of State Security (MSS); Iran's Ministry of Intelligence; and North Korean cyber units are actively
targeting the United States intelligence apparatus. The Trump administration's political purges
inadvertently served adversary interests by removing experienced counterintelligence officers and
disrupting the programs they ran.

Reconstitute the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) at full capacity and
direct the NCSC Director to produce an immediate damage assessment of foreign intelligence service
penetrations or collection activities that may have occurred during the period of IC disruption
beginning January 2025. The damage assessment will be provided to the President and to the SSCI
and HPSCI in full classified form, with an unclassified summary made available to the public within
90 days.

Issue Executive Order directing the FBI Counterintelligence Division, in coordination with CIA and
NSA, to launch a comprehensive review of all foreign intelligence service recruitment operations
against IC personnel that may have exploited the disruption period. The review will assess whether
personnel separations or security clearance disruptions created vulnerabilities that foreign services
could have exploited to gain access to classified information or recruit disgruntled former IC
employees.

Restore and enhance the Insider Threat Program across all IC components, operating within the civil
liberties framework established by the IC Civil Liberties Protection Officer. The Insider Threat
Program will be governed by clear legal standards, subject to IC IG oversight, and prohibited from
operating based on ideological criteria. It will assess genuine behavioral indicators of potential
compromise, not political viewpoints.

Establish the China Counterintelligence Task Force as a standing interagency body reporting to the
DNI, with representation from CIA, NSA, FBI, DIA, and the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and
Justice. The Task Force will coordinate the IC's response to MSS operations targeting American
research institutions, technology companies, defense contractors, and government agencies.

### Reform IX: Restore IC Analytic Tradecraft and Professional Culture

The damage done by political purges and ideological pressure on the IC extends beyond the loss of
specific individuals. It corrupts the professional culture — the norms, practices, and expectations
that govern how intelligence analysis is produced. Restoring that culture requires deliberate
institutional reinvestment that cannot be accomplished by executive order alone.

Direct the DNI to commission an independent review of IC analytic tradecraft standards, conducted
by a panel of retired senior IC officers with no current political affiliation, to assess the degree
to which professional analytic standards were compromised during the Trump administration and to
recommend specific corrective measures. The review will be completed within 180 days and
transmitted to the SSCI and HPSCI.

Restore and expand the Sherman Kent School for Intelligence Analysis, the CIA's premier analytic
training institution, to ensure that all IC analysts receive comprehensive training in analytic
tradecraft, structured analytic techniques, cognitive bias recognition, and professional ethics.
The School's curriculum will include mandatory modules on analytic independence, the history of
politicized intelligence failures, and the legal and ethical obligations of IC professionals.

Establish the IC Analytic Integrity Award, recognizing career analysts who demonstrate exceptional
commitment to objective, evidence-based analysis, particularly in circumstances where their
professional judgments are politically inconvenient. The Award, presented annually by the DNI,
will signal institutional recognition that analytic courage is a professional virtue, not a
career risk.

Direct the National Intelligence Council to restore the full scope of its analytic mission,
including the production of National Intelligence Estimates on all major strategic questions. The
NIC's authority to coordinate and produce NIEs will not be reduced or transferred to any
politically appointed body. NIEs will reflect the assessed consensus of the IC's professional
analytic community, with dissenting views included where they exist, as they always have been.

### Reform X: Artificial Intelligence Governance in the Intelligence Community

Artificial intelligence is transforming intelligence collection, analysis, and operations. The IC
is already deploying AI tools for signals processing, imagery analysis, open-source intelligence,
and pattern recognition. These capabilities can enhance IC performance substantially, but they also
create new oversight challenges, civil liberties risks, and opportunities for algorithmic bias to
corrupt analytic products at scale.

The Trump administration deployed AI capabilities within the IC without establishing adequate
governance frameworks, oversight mechanisms, or civil liberties safeguards. The same administration
that used screening algorithms to identify career officials for political purges cannot be trusted
to deploy AI in intelligence collection contexts with appropriate restraint. The next administration
will establish the governance framework that AI in the IC requires before its use further expands.

Issue Executive Order establishing the Intelligence Community AI Governance Framework, requiring
that any AI system used to produce or substantially inform intelligence assessments be subject to:
documented training data review for bias, accuracy, and reliability; independent technical
validation before operational deployment; regular audit by the IC IG; and prohibition on
AI-generated assessments being transmitted to policymakers without human analyst review and
certification.

The Framework will also establish civil liberties guardrails for AI-assisted surveillance,
including: prohibition on AI-driven autonomous targeting without human authorization and documented
legal justification; requirements for robust auditing of algorithms applied to U.S. person data;
prohibition on AI systems trained on illegally collected data; and mandatory disclosure to the
FISC of AI tools used in support of FISA applications.

Establish the IC AI Civil Liberties Review Board, operating under the IC's Civil Liberties
Protection Office (50 U.S.C. § 3029), with specific authority to review AI applications used in
intelligence collection or analysis that involve U.S. person data. The Board will have access to
all relevant classified information and will report annually to the SSCI and HPSCI. Reports will
include an unclassified summary made public, ensuring transparency about the IC's use of AI within
the bounds of classification requirements.

Direct the Director of NSA, in coordination with the IC AI Civil Liberties Review Board, to conduct
a comprehensive review of all AI applications currently deployed in signals intelligence collection
and analysis. The review will assess each application for compliance with FISA, Executive Order
12333, and applicable civil liberties standards. Applications found to be non-compliant will be
suspended pending remediation.

## Implementation Timeline

### Day One Executive Actions

The first day of the new administration will mark the beginning of the IC's institutional
restoration. These actions are immediately executable by the President without congressional action
and establish the legal and policy framework within which subsequent reforms will operate. Speed
matters: every day that politically purged professionals remain excluded from service is a day that
American intelligence capability is diminished.

- Issue Executive Order establishing binding DNI term and cause-for-removal requirement pending
  statutory codification
- Issue Executive Order establishing National Intelligence Analytic Standards prohibiting political
  direction of IC assessments
- Issue Executive Order prohibiting loyalty tests — including questions about January 6 and 2020
  election results — in IC hiring, assignment, and retention
- Issue Executive Order prohibiting use of security clearance revocation as a punitive mechanism
  and directing review of all revocations since January 20, 2025
- Issue Presidential Memorandum directing the DNI to reinstate the Global Trends strategic
  assessment program
- Issue Presidential Memorandum directing the AG to review all FISA applications submitted since
  January 20, 2025, for Woods Procedures compliance

  Threat Assessment
- Issue Presidential Memorandum directing the IC IG to complete the suppressed review of component
  IG whistleblower reprisal handling

### First 100 Days

The first 100 days will focus on completing the immediate damage assessment, beginning the personnel
restoration process, engaging allied partners, and submitting the legislative agenda to Congress.
These actions establish the trajectory of IC reform and demonstrate to the IC workforce, allied
partners, and adversaries alike that the United States has restored its commitment to professional
intelligence.

- Complete comprehensive review of all IC personnel separations and security clearance revocations
  since January 20, 2025; offer reinstatement with back pay to those improperly dismissed

  in all 50 states on current foreign influence threats
- Establish the Foreign Malign Influence Center at the ODNI
- Issue the Intelligence Community AI Governance Framework by Executive Order
- Reconstitute the NCSC at full capacity; initiate foreign penetration damage assessment
- Establish the IC Personnel Review Board

### Year 1: Foundation

Year 1 focuses on achieving key legislative milestones, completing the structural restoration of the
IC, and demonstrating measurable progress on analytic integrity and allied relationships. By the
end of Year 1, the IC's structural independence must be codified in statute rather than dependent
solely on executive policy that a future administration could reverse.

- Rebuild ODNI to pre-2025 staffing levels, prioritizing strategic analysis, civil liberties
  oversight, and interagency coordination offices
- Achieve passage of the IC Inspector General Protection Act and the FISA Court Reform and
  Transparency Act

  findings to Congress
- Develop and implement IC AI Governance Framework operational guidelines for all seventeen
  IC components
- Produce and transmit to Congress the first Annual Threat Assessment under restored professional
  standards, including climate security and election interference

### Years 2-4: Consolidation

Years 2 through 4 focus on embedding institutional reforms in statute, completing the legislative
agenda, restoring the IC's full analytic capacity, and demonstrating sustained improvement in
effectiveness metrics. By the end of Year 4, the reforms initiated in Year 1 must be sufficiently
institutionalized that they cannot be easily reversed by a future administration through executive
action alone.

- Achieve passage of the IC Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act
- Achieve passage of the IC Civil Liberties and Privacy Board Act
- Achieve passage of the Classification Reform Act
- Achieve passage of the Allied Intelligence Partnership Protection Act as permanent statute
- Complete restoration of the CIA workforce to sustainable staffing levels reflecting mission
  requirements, not political preferences
- Establish the NATO Intelligence Integration Committee under the NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre
- Produce the inaugural post-restoration Global Trends report for the 2028 quadrennial cycle
- Commission an independent assessment of IC analytic integrity, workforce morale, and international
  partnership strength; transmit to Congress in Year 4

## Success Metrics

The Intelligence Community's effectiveness ultimately cannot be fully measured in public metrics
without compromising sources and methods. However, several key indicators are measurable within
appropriate classification controls, and several can be reported publicly. The following metrics
will be tracked by the IC IG and reported to the SSCI and HPSCI annually, with unclassified
summaries published for public accountability.

**Analytic Integrity:**
- Zero documented instances of political direction of IC assessments within 24 months of the new
  administration taking office
- Resumption of comprehensive Annual Threat Assessments covering the full threat spectrum, including
  climate security and election interference, within 60 days
- Completion and publication of the 2025 Global Trends report within 180 days

The Intelligence Community exists to tell truth to power. That mission — delivering objective,
evidence-based analysis to decision-makers regardless of whether those decision-makers will find the
conclusions welcome — is not incidental to democratic governance. It is essential to it. A President
who cannot trust the IC to deliver honest assessments because the IC has been staffed for loyalty
rather than competence is a President who will be surprised by adversaries, blindsided by crises,
and betrayed by the very apparatus designed to protect the nation.

Project 2025 understood this. It was not ignorant of the consequences of politicizing intelligence.
It was indifferent to them. The Heritage Foundation's blueprint for IC reform was designed to ensure
that the IC told the President what the President wanted to hear — which is not intelligence. It is
a mirror, and mirrors do not protect nations.

The reforms in this chapter will restore the Intelligence Community's capacity to do what it was
created to do: collect, analyze, and deliver accurate intelligence, objectively and without political
interference, to the elected officials responsible for protecting the United States. That restoration
is not idealism. It is the minimum requirement for national security in an era of great power
competition, accelerating technological change, and sophisticated foreign adversaries who will
exploit every weakness the United States creates for itself.
