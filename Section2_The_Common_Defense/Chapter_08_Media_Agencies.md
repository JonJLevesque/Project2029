# Chapter 8: Federal Media and Communications Agencies

## Executive Summary

The federal government's media and communications agencies — the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), and the U.S. Agency for
Global Media (USAGM) — collectively constitute the institutional infrastructure of American
democratic discourse. The FCC licenses the broadcast spectrum that every television and radio
station depends upon. The CPB funds public broadcasting that reaches every corner of the
country, including rural and underserved communities with no viable commercial alternative.
USAGM operates Voice of America and affiliated networks that project American democratic
values — honest journalism, press freedom, and factual reporting — to authoritarian audiences
across the globe. These agencies are not peripheral bureaucracies. They are the communications
backbone of a self-governing republic.

The Trump administration, guided by Project 2025's blueprint, systematically attacked every
one of these institutions. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, the primary author of Project 2025's
chapter on the FCC, used the agency's licensing and merger review powers as instruments of
political coercion. He threatened broadcast licenses of networks that covered the
administration critically, opened investigations against ABC, NBC, and CBS, and conditioned
merger approvals on political settlements. President Trump signed Executive Order 14290,
"Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media," in May 2025, directing the CPB to cease
funding for PBS and NPR. Congress subsequently rescinded $1.1 billion in CPB appropriations,
forcing the organization to announce its dissolution. Kari Lake, installed at USAGM over
legal objection, dismantled Voice of America from the inside — slashing staff from 1,300 to
fewer than 100 employees, eliminating service in dozens of languages, partnering with One
America News Network to provide propaganda content, and appearing on VOA's own
Persian-language service to deliver pro-Trump promotional content in violation of the
editorial firewall required by federal law.

The damage is comprehensive, deliberate, and in many cases irreversible without congressional
action. The incoming Democratic administration inherits a communications landscape in which
the public broadcaster has been dissolved, the federal international broadcasting service has
been gutted and partially converted into a domestic political propaganda channel, and the FCC
has been openly deployed as a weapon against journalistic independence. Restoring these
institutions requires not merely executive reversal but new legislation, structural reforms,
and renewed statutory protections that make the next generation of political attacks far
harder to mount.

**The Stakes**: Free and independent media is not a luxury feature of democracy — it is the
mechanism by which citizens hold power accountable, evaluate competing policy claims, and
make informed electoral judgments. When the government weaponizes broadcast licensing to
punish critical coverage, defunds the public broadcaster that serves tens of millions of rural
and low-income Americans, and transforms an international journalism agency into a domestic
propaganda organ, it does not merely inconvenience the press. It attacks the capacity of
citizens to govern themselves. The institutions destroyed between 2025 and 2026 took decades
to build and can be destroyed in months. Rebuilding them, and hardening them against future
political attack, is a constitutional obligation.

**Key Reforms**:
- Restore and structurally insulate FCC independence through statutory commissioner
  protections and clear limits on presidential interference in licensing decisions
- Re-establish CPB, PBS, and NPR with tripled federal funding ($1.5 billion annually), a
  10-year funding authorization, and statutory firewalls preventing executive defunding by
  order
- Rebuild USAGM and Voice of America to their pre-2025 operational capacity, with restored
  workforce, multilingual services, and enforceable editorial independence under the BBG
  Firewall statute (22 U.S.C. § 6202(b))
- Enact net neutrality through statute, permanently classifying broadband as a Title II
  telecommunications service to prevent ISP throttling, blocking, and paid prioritization
- Reverse FCC media concentration deregulation and strengthen local ownership limits to
  prevent further monopolization of broadcast markets
- Establish a statutory Local Journalism Preservation Fund within CPB providing $500 million
  annually in grants to local news outlets
- Reform Section 230 narrowly to preserve platform liability protections for hosting
  third-party speech while closing specific gaps exploited for coordinated disinformation
- Modernize the Emergency Alert System (EAS) with interoperable digital infrastructure and
  accessibility requirements for deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans
- Prohibit FCC use of licensing proceedings as political retaliation by requiring judicial
  review before any license revocation proceeding may proceed against a major broadcast
  network
- Protect LGBTQ+ and minority broadcasters through strengthened FCC equal opportunity
  regulations under 47 C.F.R. Part 73

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151 et seq.;
Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, 47 U.S.C. § 396; U.S. International Broadcasting Act of
1994, 22 U.S.C. §§ 6201 et seq.; First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq.; *Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC*, 395 U.S. 367
(1969); *FCC v. League of Women Voters*, 468 U.S. 364 (1984).

## Part I: Project 2025 Media Agency Damage and Destruction

### The FCC as Political Weapon: License Threats Against Critical Broadcasters

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on FCC reform and was designated FCC Chairman by
President Trump on January 20, 2025. He immediately converted the agency from an independent
regulator into an instrument of presidential political pressure. Project 2025 directed that
the FCC abandon its historic role as a neutral arbiter of the public interest and instead use
its licensing and enforcement powers aggressively against media outlets the administration
characterized as biased.

**License Revocation Threats as Political Intimidation:**

In August 2025, Trump publicly demanded on Truth Social that ABC and NBC lose their broadcast
licenses over coverage he characterized as unfair, writing that they should "lose their
Licenses for their unfair coverage of Republicans and/or Conservatives." Chairman Carr echoed
these demands, announcing FCC investigations into ABC, NBC, and CBS. The procedural vehicle
for these investigations was complaints filed through the conservative Center for American
Rights — a partisan organization with no regulatory standing.

These investigations had no legitimate regulatory basis. No broadcaster in the United States
had lost a major license since the 1980s, and that case involved bribery, not editorial
content. The investigations were designed not to succeed in revocation but to intimidate, to
impose legal costs on targeted networks, and to signal to every broadcast journalist in the
country the personal price of aggressive coverage of the administration.

**Merger Review as Extortion:**

The administration used FCC merger review powers as an even more effective tool of coercion.
When Paramount sought FCC approval for its merger with Skydance, Chairman Carr delayed the
review while Trump's lawyers negotiated with Paramount over a separate lawsuit Trump had
filed against CBS's "60 Minutes" program. Paramount ultimately agreed to pay $16 million
toward Trump's future presidential library — a settlement with no legitimate legal basis for
the underlying lawsuit — to secure regulatory clearance.

This was not informal pressure. It was a formal regulatory merger proceeding used as leverage
to extract money and political compliance from a regulated entity. It constitutes precisely
the kind of governmental coercion the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act
prohibit. No prior administration in the modern regulatory era had used FCC merger authority
as explicit ransom in pending presidential litigation.

**The "Delete, Delete, Delete" Deregulation Blitz:**

Carr simultaneously launched what he called the "Delete, Delete, Delete" initiative,
eliminating 1,108 rules and regulations covering consumer protections, media ownership
limits, and public interest obligations. In 2025 alone, the FCC proposed elimination of
312 pages of the Code of Federal Regulations governing broadcast public interest standards
developed over 90 years.

Specific casualties included:
- FCC equal opportunity employment regulations for broadcasters, eliminating diversity hiring
  requirements
- Children's educational programming requirements, eliminating rules requiring broadcast
  stations to air programming serving the educational needs of children
- Local television and radio ownership caps, opening the door to further consolidation of
  local media markets into national conglomerate ownership
- Broadband consumer privacy rules requiring ISPs to obtain opt-in consent before selling
  browsing data

### The Destruction of Public Broadcasting

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 explicitly called for the elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting, characterizing public broadcasting as ideologically biased and
incompatible with conservative governance. **"The CPB should eventually be privatized or
eliminated. Federal funding of public broadcasting is an unnecessary and potentially harmful
government intervention in the media market."** *(Project 2025, p. 253)*

**Executive Order 14290 — Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of "Biased Media":**

On May 1, 2025, Trump signed Executive Order 14290, "Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of
Biased Media," directing CPB to cease all direct federal funding to NPR and PBS. The order
characterized public broadcasting's editorial choices as evidence of institutional political
bias — a characterization that provided no legal basis for the executive to override a
congressional appropriation, but which served as the pretext for the administration's
defunding campaign.

**Congressional Rescission — The $1.1 Billion Clawback:**

In June 2025, the administration asked Congress to rescind previously appropriated CPB
funding. Congress complied with the rescissions bill, clawing back $1.1 billion in CPB
appropriations covering the next two fiscal years. This was the entire forward funding that
Congress had appropriated specifically to insulate CPB from precisely this kind of
year-to-year political attack.

The $1.1 billion rescission left CPB without operating funds. The organization announced it
would wind down operations, eliminating approximately 100 staff positions. On January 6, 2026,
the CPB board voted to dissolve the organization entirely — ending the institution that had
provided federal support for public broadcasting since 1967.

**Consequences for Public Media Infrastructure:**

PBS and NPR were left without federal funding. The consequences cascaded immediately:
- Approximately 170 public television stations faced funding shortfalls or closure
- Hundreds of public radio stations faced operational cuts or elimination
- Rural markets with no commercial broadcasting alternative faced information voids
- Native American tribal radio stations that depended on CPB community grants faced shutdown
- Low-income families without cable or broadband whose children relied on PBS educational
  programming lost access to that programming
- Hearing-impaired viewers whose captioning and audio description needs the commercial sector
  routinely underfunds lost the public broadcasting alternative

States like Alaska, Wyoming, and Montana — where commercial broadcasting is thin and
geography makes cable infrastructure prohibitively expensive — face the prospect of entire
communities with no local over-the-air television news whatsoever.

### Voice of America Converted to State Propaganda

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 called for restructuring USAGM to place it under direct presidential control,
eliminating the editorial firewall that has separated U.S. international broadcasting from
government propaganda since the firewall's statutory enactment in 1994. **"The bipartisan
BBG board should be abolished. The CEO should be made a political appointee with direct
accountability to the President."** *(Project 2025, p. 247)*

**The March 2025 Shutdown:**

The administration's execution was swift and devastating. In March 2025, an executive order
placed virtually all USAGM staff — approximately 1,300 employees — on administrative leave,
effectively shutting down operations across Voice of America and all affiliated networks.
The immediate cessation of broadcasts left audiences in 49 countries without the service.

**Kari Lake's Appointment and Dismantlement:**

Trump announced the appointment of Kari Lake — a former Arizona television news anchor who
had become a leading 2020 election denier and failed political candidate — to lead the
agency. Lake had no credentials in international broadcasting, foreign policy, or journalism
management. She had never run a major media organization. Her sole qualification was personal
loyalty to the President who appointed her.

Lake proceeded to dismantle VOA from the inside:
- Cut the workforce from approximately 1,300 to fewer than 100 employees
- Reduced the agency from 49 language services to four
- Announced a partnership with One America News Network — a domestic far-right propaganda
  outlet — to provide news content to USAGM networks
- Called, in a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, for USAGM to be abolished entirely,
  its editorial firewall shredded, and its remaining journalists replaced with freelancers
  producing **"patriotic puff pieces"**
- Eliminated the visa program that allowed foreign national journalists to work as native
  language reporters — the foundation of VOA's multilingual capacity

**Direct Propaganda: The January 2026 Firewall Violation:**

In January 2026, Lake appeared personally on VOA's Persian-language service and delivered
effusive praise for President Trump. This was a direct violation of the statutory editorial
firewall codified at 22 U.S.C. § 6202(b), which prohibits the USAGM CEO from directing or
influencing the content of broadcasts. A United States government official used a federally
funded international broadcasting service — legally required to provide independent, balanced
journalism — to broadcast domestic political propaganda to Iranian audiences.

**Legal Challenges:**

Federal courts partially checked the dismantlement. A federal judge ruled that the
administration's mass firings were "arbitrary and capricious" and temporarily blocked
them. Democracy Forward litigated the VOA shutdown directly. An appellate court partially
reversed the injunction but affirmed VOA's statutory obligation to serve as a
**"consistently reliable and authoritative source of news."** The administration accepted
the partial loss and continued operations at a fraction of prior capacity.

**The Geopolitical Damage:**

Voice of America's reduction from 1,300 staff to fewer than 100 represents the near-total
destruction of an agency that had served, at its peak, audiences of approximately 280 million
people in 47 languages. The damage is not merely institutional:

- In Iran, where VOA's Persian service was one of the few sources of uncensored information
  available to an authoritarian-governed population, the service was gutted at a moment when
  that population was engaged in ongoing resistance movements against the regime
- In China and Russia, where VOA and affiliated services provided news independent of state
  propaganda, the information vacuum will be filled by state-controlled foreign media
  from Beijing and Moscow
- In Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, where VOA provided democratic information
  infrastructure, the reduction in service represents a unilateral retreat by the United
  States from the information competition that shapes political outcomes in fragile democracies

### Net Neutrality Eliminated and Broadband Deregulation

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 directed the FCC to abandon net neutrality, reclassify broadband as an
"information service" not subject to Title II common carrier obligations, and eliminate all
FCC authority to regulate internet service provider conduct. **"The FCC should return to
treating broadband as an information service — as the statute requires — and end the FCC's
experiment with utility-style regulation of the internet."** *(Project 2025, p. 239)*

**The Sixth Circuit Vacatur:**

The Biden FCC had restored net neutrality in 2024 through its "Safeguarding and Securing the
Open Internet" order, reclassifying broadband under Title II. The Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals, in January 2025, vacated the FCC's 2024 order. The court ruled that the
Communications Act did not authorize Title II classification of broadband — relying in part
on the post-*Chevron* statutory construction framework from *Loper Bright Enterprises v.
Raimondo* (2024).

The Trump FCC declined to appeal and declined to pursue any alternative regulatory approach.
Internet service providers were left free to throttle streaming services, offer paid "fast
lanes" to content providers willing to pay premiums, and block competing services. Without
net neutrality, every ISP in the country can discriminate among content based on commercial
relationships — treating streaming video from a competitor differently than its own service,
favoring affiliated news content over independent journalism, or degrading bandwidth to
services that have not paid for priority treatment.

**The Broadband Privacy Rollback:**

Carr's "Delete, Delete, Delete" initiative further eliminated FCC consumer privacy
regulations that required ISPs to obtain opt-in consent before collecting, sharing, or
selling subscribers' browsing data to advertisers. These rules were important because ISPs,
unlike websites, observe the entirety of a subscriber's internet activity across all
platforms. Their elimination permits every major broadband provider to monetize detailed
records of subscribers' reading habits, health research, political views, and personal
communications without any requirement of consumer consent.

---

### The Human Cost

The combined effect of these policies has produced concrete, documented damage to millions
of Americans.

**Public Media Loss:**
- Approximately 170 public television stations and hundreds of public radio stations face
  funding shortfalls or closure following CPB's dissolution
- The most acute impacts are concentrated in rural markets, Native American communities, and
  low-income urban neighborhoods — populations that commercial media has never adequately
  served
- An estimated 120 million weekly PBS viewers and tens of millions of NPR listeners face
  reduced programming and service interruptions

**International Broadcasting Loss:**
- Voice of America's reduction from 1,300 staff to fewer than 100 represents the near-total
  destruction of an agency that served approximately 280 million people weekly
- The editorial firewall violation by Kari Lake in January 2026 permanently damaged VOA's
  credibility as an independent news source in the eyes of international audiences
- The OAN content partnership converted a professional journalism operation into a conduit
  for domestic partisan content beamed at foreign audiences

**Media Consolidation Acceleration:**
- Approximately 1,800 local newspapers have closed since 2004; the "Delete, Delete, Delete"
  initiative eliminated regulatory barriers preventing further consolidation
- Local television news stations have been absorbed into national ownership groups
  eliminating local reporting
- Radio markets in smaller cities have become effectively monopolized by national chains
  with no local editorial operations

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

The constitutional foundation for federal broadcast regulation rests on the finite nature of
the electromagnetic spectrum. Congress established the FCC in 1934 under its Commerce Clause
authority (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3) to allocate broadcast licenses in the public
interest, because the spectrum cannot accommodate unlimited simultaneous users without
interference. Broadcast licensees hold their licenses in trust for the public, not as a
matter of private property right. This public trust doctrine is the constitutional basis for
the "public interest, convenience, and necessity" standard codified at 47 U.S.C. § 309.

The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of broadcast content regulation in *Red
Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC*, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), holding unanimously that because
broadcasters are licensed to use a scarce public resource, they may be required to operate
in the public interest, including providing balanced coverage of controversial public issues.
*Red Lion* has never been overruled and remains controlling precedent for broadcast
regulation.

The First Amendment constrains but does not eliminate congressional authority over broadcast
content. *FCC v. League of Women Voters*, 468 U.S. 364 (1984), struck down a ban on
editorial endorsements by public broadcasters on First Amendment grounds while affirming
the broader framework of public interest regulation. Government cannot compel specific
speech or suppress viewpoints, but may set structural conditions on how licensed broadcasters
operate in the public interest.

Public funding of broadcasting is constitutional government speech. *Rust v. Sullivan*,
500 U.S. 173 (1991), and subsequent cases establish that government may make content choices
in programs it funds, subject to limits against viewpoint discrimination and unconstitutional
conditions. The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 was expressly designed to insulate CPB from
political interference by establishing it as a private nonprofit corporation rather than a
federal agency — a structural choice with significant constitutional implications for
executive control.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151 et seq.**

The foundational statute establishing the FCC and its jurisdiction. Key provisions include:
- Section 307: FCC authority to grant broadcast licenses in the public interest
- Section 309: "Public interest, convenience, and necessity" licensing standard
- Section 326: Express prohibition on FCC censorship of broadcast content
- Section 396: Corporation for Public Broadcasting (integrated via the Public Broadcasting
  Act of 1967)

Section 326's anti-censorship provision is central to the unconstitutionality of politically
motivated license revocation proceedings. The section provides that the FCC "shall not have
the power of censorship over the radio communications or signals transmitted by any radio
station, and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the Commission
which shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communication."

**Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, 47 U.S.C. § 396**

Establishes the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as a private nonprofit corporation,
appropriates federal funding, and directs CPB to maintain strict objectivity and balance in
all programming of a controversial nature. The act's structure deliberately places CPB at
one remove from direct federal control to prevent political influence over programming.

**U.S. International Broadcasting Act of 1994, 22 U.S.C. §§ 6201 et seq.**

Governs USAGM and Voice of America. Key provisions include:
- Section 6202(a): VOA must "present the policies of the United States clearly and
  effectively, and will also present responsible discussion and opinion on these policies"
- Section 6202(b): The editorial firewall. The USAGM CEO and Board may not "direct or
  control the content of any broadcast." Broadcasting is required to "be consistent with the
  highest professional standards of broadcast journalism"
- These provisions were violated by Kari Lake's January 2026 Persian-service appearance

**Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq.**

Governs all FCC rulemaking. The "Delete, Delete, Delete" initiative, to the extent it
eliminates rules without notice-and-comment rulemaking or without reasoned explanation
consistent with the record, violates the APA's requirement that agency action not be
arbitrary or capricious. Courts reviewing APA challenges examine whether the agency
"examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action."
*Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co.*,
463 U.S. 29 (1983).

### First Amendment Constraints on Political Retaliation

The First Amendment constrains license revocation proceedings aimed at editorial content.
47 U.S.C. § 326 expressly prohibits FCC censorship. Courts have interpreted this provision
to preclude licensing decisions based on editorial content or political viewpoint.

The Supreme Court's decision in *Reno v. ACLU*, 521 U.S. 844 (1997), and subsequent
internet speech cases establish that government may not impose content-based speech
restrictions without satisfying strict scrutiny. Using FCC licensing authority to punish
broadcasters for critical editorial coverage constitutes viewpoint discrimination — the
most constitutionally disfavored form of government speech regulation.

The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, articulated in *Agency for International
Development v. Alliance for Open Society International*, 570 U.S. 205 (2013), prohibits
government from conditioning a benefit — including a broadcast license — on the recipient's
relinquishment of First Amendment rights. Threatening license revocation based on editorial
content is precisely the unconstitutional condition this doctrine prohibits.

### International Broadcasting Law

The U.S. International Broadcasting Act of 1994 reflects a deliberate policy choice: the
United States can project democratic values more effectively through credible independent
journalism than through state-controlled messaging. The editorial firewall is not merely a
statutory formality; it is the mechanism that gives VOA credibility with audiences who
receive it as an alternative to their own governments' propaganda.

Authoritarian governments routinely jam or block VOA broadcasts precisely because its
independence makes it credible. A Voice of America that broadcasts pro-Trump promotional
content loses that credibility permanently — not just for the Trump era, but for every
subsequent administration that seeks to use VOA as a tool of democratic public diplomacy.

## Part III: Comprehensive Media Agency Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: Restore FCC Independence and Prohibit Political Retaliation

**Day One Executive Action:**

Issue an Executive Order on Day One directing the FCC to suspend all pending license
revocation proceedings initiated against broadcast networks following the August 2025 Trump
social media posts. The order will direct the FCC's Office of General Counsel to review
whether any pending proceeding violates 47 U.S.C. § 326's anti-censorship provision or
constitutes viewpoint-based retaliation prohibited under the First Amendment.

Nominate a full complement of FCC commissioners committed to genuine regulatory independence,
restoring the bipartisan structure the Communications Act requires. The FCC must have three
commissioners from the President's party and two from the opposition at all times.

**The FCC Independence and Anti-Retaliation Act:**

Propose to Congress legislation that will:
- Prohibit the FCC from initiating any license revocation or renewal challenge proceeding
  against a broadcast network with national coverage without affirmative approval by four
  of the five commissioners
- Require that any license challenge based on news content be reviewed by an independent
  Administrative Law Judge insulated from political direction
- Impose personal liability on commissioners who vote to initiate proceedings the reviewing
  ALJ finds were motivated by viewpoint discrimination
- Prohibit using merger review proceedings as leverage in litigation settlement negotiations,
  expressly codifying a ban on the Paramount-library-payment pattern
- Require that FCC merger reviews proceed on a fixed statutory timeline, with automatic
  approval if the FCC fails to act within the statutory period, to prevent deliberate delay
  as a coercion mechanism

---

### Reform II: Rebuild the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Public Media

**The Public Media Restoration and Independence Act:**

Introduce and enact comprehensive legislation re-establishing CPB with permanent structural
independence. Key provisions:

**Funding and Authorization:**
- Re-establish CPB as a private nonprofit corporation under 47 U.S.C. § 396
- Appropriate $1.5 billion annually — triple the $500 million funding level before the 2025
  defunding, reflecting both inflation since 1967 and the expanded digital mission
- Provide a 10-year forward funding authorization, locked against executive order defunding
- Require a supermajority vote of both chambers of Congress to rescind any CPB appropriation,
  preventing a repeat of the 2025 simple majority rescission

**The Local Journalism Preservation Fund:**

Establish within CPB a $500 million annual competitive grant program for local news:
- Eligible recipients include nonprofit and for-profit local news organizations meeting
  journalism standards: editorial independence, corrections policy, conflict-of-interest
  disclosure, and demonstrated commitment to local coverage
- Priority weighting for outlets serving communities with no other local news source
- Eligible formats: local newspapers, digital-only outlets, local television news, local
  radio news operations
- Grants disbursed by an independent board of journalism professionals; no political
  appointee may serve on the grant review board

**The Investigative Journalism Fund:**

Establish a $200 million annual fund for accountability journalism:
- Managed by an independent board of senior journalists appointed by the CPB board
- Funds investigative reporting on federal, state, and local government accountability
- No grant may be awarded to an outlet whose primary funders include any entity currently
  under active federal investigation or regulatory proceeding

**Editorial Independence Protections:**

Enact specific statutory protections for PBS and NPR's editorial independence:
- Prohibit the CPB board from directing content decisions at PBS or NPR
- Require that editorial leadership at PBS and NPR be hired by each organization's own
  professional board without CPB veto
- Establish a clear statutory distinction between CPB's grant-making function and the
  editorial autonomy of organizations it funds
- Permit any CPB-funded organization to sue for injunctive relief against any CPB or
  executive action that violates editorial independence protections

**Digital and Accessibility Expansion:**

Direct CPB to fund public media's digital transition:
- Public media streaming infrastructure, podcast distribution, and digital-first content
  designed to reach audiences under 35
- Mandate full accessibility: all CPB-funded content must include closed captions and
  audio description tracks within two years of enactment
- Multilingual content expansion reflecting the linguistic diversity of American communities

---

### Reform III: Restore Voice of America and USAGM Editorial Independence

**Day One Executive Action:**

Issue an Executive Order within the first week of the administration:
- Immediately suspend Kari Lake's appointment and all directives she issued affecting
  USAGM's editorial content, staffing, or organizational structure
- Appoint an interim USAGM CEO with professional international broadcasting credentials,
  subject to Senate confirmation for the permanent appointment
- Restore the editorial firewall under 22 U.S.C. § 6202(b), prohibiting all political
  appointees from participating in, directing, or influencing the content of any broadcast
- Terminate the OAN content partnership immediately, on grounds that OAN content does not
  meet the professional journalism standards required by 22 U.S.C. § 6202(b)

**Independent Audit:**

Commission an independent audit of all content produced by VOA and affiliated networks
between January 2025 and the date of the new administration's inauguration, examining
compliance with the statutory mandate for balanced, accurate, and professional journalism.
The audit will document all instances of editorial firewall violation, political content
injection, and departure from professional journalism standards. The audit report will be
submitted to Congress and made public.

**Workforce Rebuilding:**

Initiate a workforce rebuilding plan targeting restoration to at least 1,000 professional
staff within 18 months. Specific measures:
- Reinstate the visa program for foreign national journalists that Kari Lake eliminated
- Offer reinstatement to all employees terminated or constructively forced out between
  January 2025 and inauguration
- Restore all language services that were eliminated, with a priority triage based on
  geopolitical urgency: Persian, Mandarin, Russian, and Arabic services first, completing
  full restoration to 49 languages within 24 months

**The USAGM Permanent Independence Act:**

Propose legislation codifying the editorial firewall in stronger statutory terms:
- Prohibit appointment of any individual who has been a registered political operative,
  campaign official, or party officer within the prior five years to any leadership position
  at USAGM, VOA, Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, or any affiliated entity
- Require that the USAGM Board be majority composed of former senior journalists, foreign
  policy professionals, or international law experts, with no more than two members affiliated
  with any single political party
- Require annual independent compliance audit of the editorial firewall, with results
  submitted to Congress
- Establish civil penalties — not merely removal — for firewall violations, creating
  deterrence for future political appointees

---

### Reform IV: Restore Net Neutrality Through Legislation

**The Open Internet Act:**

The Sixth Circuit's January 2025 ruling places net neutrality permanently beyond FCC
administrative action absent clear statutory authority. Congress must act. Introduce and
enact the Open Internet Act of 202X:

**Core Provisions:**
- Amend 47 U.S.C. § 153 to explicitly classify broadband internet access service as a
  "telecommunications service" subject to Title II common carrier obligations
- Prohibit ISPs from blocking any lawful content, application, service, or device
- Prohibit throttling — degrading connection speeds based on content or service provider
  identity
- Prohibit paid prioritization — "fast lane" arrangements that favor content providers
  who pay premium fees
- Prohibit anti-competitive zero-rating — exempting affiliated content from data caps while
  counting competing content against subscriber limits
- Restore FCC rulemaking authority over ISP conduct, subject to the APA's notice-and-comment
  and arbitrary-and-capricious review standards

**Private Enforcement:**

Include a private right of action allowing any content provider or consumer injured by an
ISP's discriminatory practices to bring suit in federal district court for injunctive relief
and damages. Private enforcement supplements FCC enforcement and ensures net neutrality
obligations remain enforceable even during periods of weakened FCC leadership.

**Broadband Consumer Privacy:**

Restore and strengthen FCC consumer privacy rules for broadband subscribers:
- Require opt-in consent before ISPs may share, sell, or use for advertising purposes any
  data derived from subscribers' internet usage
- Require ISPs to provide subscribers with accessible disclosure of all data collected and
  all third parties to whom it has been disclosed
- Establish a private right of action for privacy violations with statutory damages

---

### Reform V: Reverse Media Consolidation and Restore Ownership Limits

**Immediate Administrative Reversal:**

Direct the FCC to reinstate the media ownership rules that existed as of January 19, 2025,
pending a full notice-and-comment rulemaking. The reinstatement is appropriate as an
administrative reversal of rules eliminated through proceedings that violated the APA's
requirement for reasoned decision-making. Every rule eliminated under "Delete, Delete,
Delete" without adequate APA process is vulnerable to reversal on administrative grounds.

**Comprehensive Quadrennial Review:**

Conduct a comprehensive ownership review examining:
- Local television news concentration, including the proportion of markets where a single
  owner controls more than one major broadcast television news operation
- National radio consolidation and its effects on local programming and local news
- The relationship between hedge fund and private equity ownership of local newspapers and
  the documented closure of local reporting operations
- Market power of national cable and satellite providers in local advertising markets

The review will produce proposed rules within 24 months.

**The Local News Ownership Diversity Act:**

Introduce legislation establishing:
- Restoration of the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership prohibition in markets with fewer
  than eight independently owned media voices
- A Local Ownership Preference in FCC license transfers, requiring that competitive bids
  from locally owned and locally operated applicants receive weighting against national
  chain bidders
- Tax incentives for the transfer of local media properties to employee-owned cooperatives,
  local nonprofit organizations, or community foundations
- Strengthened FCC EEO regulations at 47 C.F.R. Part 73, requiring annual reporting on
  hiring, promotion, and outreach practices as a condition of license renewal
- Statutory protection for LGBTQ+ broadcasters against viewpoint-based license denials —
  prohibiting the FCC from considering a licensee's support for LGBTQ+ rights or broadcast
  of LGBTQ+ content as a factor adverse to license renewal

### Reform VI: Section 230 Targeted Reform Protecting Speech

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. § 230, provides that online
platforms are not treated as publishers of third-party content. This protection enables the
open internet. The Trump administration threatened to weaponize Section 230 reform to coerce
platforms into suppressing content the administration dislikes. The correct approach is
narrow, evidence-based reform that closes specific harms without destroying the liability
framework that enables open platforms.

**The Section 230 Targeted Reform Act:**

- Extend Section 230(c)(1) protection to platforms' good-faith moderation decisions,
  explicitly overruling interpretations that would impose liability for choices to remove
  harmful content
- Create a narrow exception to Section 230 immunity for platforms that knowingly host and
  algorithmically amplify coordinated inauthentic behavior — specifically, content produced
  and distributed by networks of fake accounts created to simulate organic public opinion
- Require transparency reports from platforms with more than 10 million monthly active users
  on moderation practices, including categories of content removed, appeals granted, and
  appeal outcomes
- Prohibit any federal agency from conditioning any benefit, license, or regulatory approval
  on a platform's modification of its content moderation policies — codifying a prohibition
  on governmental coercion of platform editorial decisions
- Preserve full immunity for all other third-party speech hosting, including controversial
  but lawful speech

### Reform VII: Emergency Alert System Modernization

The Emergency Alert System serves a life-safety function: it delivers warnings of natural
disasters, civil emergencies, and threats to life across all broadcast platforms, reaching
people regardless of internet or cellular access. Current EAS infrastructure relies
substantially on legacy analog technology and has significant accessibility gaps.

**The EAS Modernization Initiative:**

Issue an Executive Order directing the FCC to initiate an EAS modernization proceeding
within 90 days of inauguration. The proceeding will address:
- Interoperability between broadcast-based EAS and Wireless Emergency Alerts delivered
  via cellular networks, eliminating gaps where a warning reaches some platforms but not
  others
- Full accessibility compliance: real-time captioning for all EAS alerts, audio description
  for visual alerts, and multilingual alert capability in markets with large
  non-English-speaking populations
- Cybersecurity hardening of EAS infrastructure, which has been subject to spoofing attacks
  that have broadcast false emergency messages
- Extension of EAS requirements to streaming services with more than one million subscribers,
  which are currently exempt

Fund the modernization through the Universal Service Fund, redirecting a portion of USF
contributions — currently approximately $9 billion annually — toward EAS infrastructure
grants to broadcast stations and local governments.

### Reform VIII: Broadband Universal Access

Universal broadband access is inseparable from media and communications policy. A citizen
without broadband access cannot access streaming public media, participate in digital public
discourse, or benefit from net neutrality protections. Approximately 21 million Americans —
predominantly rural, low-income, and elderly — lack reliable broadband access.

**The Broadband Universal Service Program:**

Establish within the FCC's Universal Service Fund framework a Broadband Universal Service
Program:
- Provide subsidized broadband access to households below 200% of the federal poverty line
- Require that any carrier receiving USF broadband subsidy funds provide at minimum
  100/20 Mbps service (escalating from an initial 25/3 Mbps standard within four years)
  at a monthly cost not to exceed $30 for eligible households
- Direct the FCC to implement this program through rulemaking within 180 days of enactment

**E-Rate Library Expansion:**

Expand the E-Rate program (47 U.S.C. § 254(h)) to fund broadband access in all public
libraries:
- Ensure that every public library in the United States offers free public broadband access
  at speeds sufficient for video streaming and video conferencing
- Libraries are the broadband access point of last resort for millions of Americans; their
  connectivity infrastructure must be maintained and expanded as a public good
