# Chapter 9: U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)

## Executive Summary

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was established by President John F. Kennedy through Executive Order 10924 in 1961 and codified under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 U.S.C. § 2151 et seq. For sixty-four years, USAID served as the primary instrument of American soft power and humanitarian leadership — administering development assistance, global health programs, food aid, democracy promotion, and disaster response across more than 100 countries. USAID trained foreign health workers who contained pandemics before they crossed American borders, supported civil society organizations that checked authoritarian governments, funded food programs that prevented famine in the world's most fragile states, and kept 20 million HIV-positive individuals alive through PEPFAR. It was not charity — it was strategic statecraft backed by congressional authority and decades of bipartisan consensus.

The Trump administration, beginning January 20, 2025, obliterated this institution with deliberate speed. Acting under the direction of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — an unelected, unconfirmed shadow apparatus with no constitutional authority over federal agencies — the administration froze all foreign assistance funding, placed 4,700 employees on administrative leave, terminated 1,600 positions outright, canceled 5,200 contracts representing 83% of all USAID programs, and dismantled the agency's IT systems, websites, and physical facilities. On July 1, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that USAID had officially ceased to exist as an independent agency, with a stripped remnant absorbed into the State Department under conditions designed to eliminate development expertise. Federal courts ruled these actions likely unconstitutional, citing violations of the separation of powers and the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. The Supreme Court ultimately permitted the funding freeze to stand, siding with executive impoundment in a decision that gutted a fifty-year-old statutory protection against presidential usurpation of the power of the purse.

This chapter details what was destroyed, the legal framework for restoration, and the specific actions required to rebuild USAID as an independent, fully resourced, and structurally strengthened agency for the next Democratic administration. Restoration is not optional. The vacuum left by USAID's destruction has accelerated famine, revived infectious disease outbreaks, empowered authoritarian regimes, and severed alliances built over generations.

**The Stakes**: The dissolution of USAID is not a budgetary abstraction. The World Food Programme reports that U.S. cuts forced a 34% reduction in projected resources, reducing emergency food assistance for up to 16.7 million people. An internal USAID memorandum documented that the elimination of global health security programs alone risks more than 28,000 new cases of dangerous infectious diseases annually. Authoritarian governments in Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and El Salvador openly celebrated USAID's demise because the agency had funded the civil society organizations, independent media, and human rights defenders those regimes most feared. Pandemics incubate in the absence of surveillance. Famines metastasize without early intervention. Democracies fail without civic infrastructure. The cost of inaction compounds daily.

**Key Reforms**:
- Issue Executive Order on Day One reconstituting USAID as an independent agency and revoking all executive actions that suspended or terminated its operations
- Restore PEPFAR to full funding and statutory mandate under 22 U.S.C. § 7601, securing continuity of HIV treatment for 20.6 million patients
- Emergency reinstatement of food security and humanitarian assistance programs through the Food for Peace Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1691, reversing contract terminations in Afghanistan, Haiti, Syria, and Yemen
- Rehire dismissed career USAID workforce and void improper separation actions taken through non-statutory DOGE directives
- Restore global health security programs including Ebola, mpox, H5N1, and tuberculosis outbreak surveillance and response capacity
- Rebuild democracy, human rights, and governance programming across 120+ countries, with a focus on Ukraine, Myanmar, Belarus, Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua
- Enact the USAID Statutory Independence Act to codify the agency's independent status in federal law, insulating it from future executive dissolution
- Establish the Foreign Assistance Accountability Office to provide independent oversight of aid effectiveness and ensure compliance with congressional appropriations directives
- Launch the Global Health Security Reinvestment Initiative to rebuild bilateral and multilateral surveillance networks dismantled in 2025
- Restore climate resilience and adaptation assistance programs under the Foreign Assistance Act and the Paris Agreement implementation framework

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. § 2151 et seq.); PEPFAR Statute (22 U.S.C. § 7601 et seq.); Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. § 1691 et seq.); Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.); State Department Basic Authorities Act (22 U.S.C. § 2651 et seq.); International Food Assistance Reporting Act; Global Food Security Act of 2016 (22 U.S.C. § 9301); Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989; Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706).

## Part I: Project 2025 USAID Damage and Destruction

### The Ideological Blueprint

Project 2025 — the Heritage Foundation's 922-page governing manual titled Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise — devoted a dedicated chapter to USAID authored by Max Primorac, a former USAID official. The document explicitly called for dismantling USAID's development mission in favor of a transactional foreign policy model: **"The next conservative administration should scale back USAID's global footprint by, at a minimum, returning to the agency's 2019 pre-COVID-19 pandemic budget level. It should deradicalize USAID's programs and structures."** *(Project 2025, p. 254)*

The chapter attacked gender equity programming, environmental assistance, and civil society support as ideologically contaminated. It called for eliminating the Office of Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment, defunding democracy promotion programs it characterized as "political activism," and subordinating development goals to private-sector investment frameworks that prioritize market returns over humanitarian outcomes. Project 2025 envisioned USAID not as a humanitarian agency but as a foreign policy instrument, focused narrowly on countering China and conditioning aid on recipient country compliance with U.S. conservative social policy.

Project 2025 directed the next conservative President to appoint a "pro-life coordinator" within USAID and to implement the Geneva Consensus Declaration — a Trump-era document coordinated with authoritarian governments including Brazil, Egypt, and Uganda — as a guiding framework for health programming. This would have subordinated evidence-based global health practice to social policy ideology. Project 2025 further called for prioritizing faith-based organizations as implementing partners and scaling back USAID's engagement with multilateral bodies including the United Nations and the World Health Organization.

Critically, Project 2025 framed foreign assistance not as humanitarian obligation or development investment but as a tool of strategic competition with China. The document called for USAID to "strengthen partnerships with pro-market democratic allies (Japan, Australia, South Korea, India and Taiwan) to advance private-sector solutions" while reducing or eliminating programs in countries the administration deemed insufficiently aligned with U.S. political interests. This transactional framework would condition life-saving aid on geopolitical loyalty — a fundamental perversion of both humanitarian law and effective development practice.

What the administration actually implemented exceeded even Project 2025's blueprint. Elon Musk, operating through DOGE without Senate confirmation or statutory authority, accelerated and radicalized the dismantling — terminating programs that Project 2025 had not targeted and collapsing the agency entirely rather than merely shrinking it. Newsweek reported in early 2025 that Musk's approach to USAID actually split with parts of the Project 2025 agenda, going further in dissolution than even the Heritage Foundation had contemplated. The result was not reform but elimination.

### The DOGE Dismantling — A Constitutional Violation

**What Project 2025 and the Trump Administration Did:**

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order freezing virtually all U.S. foreign assistance programs, directing a 90-day review of all State Department and USAID aid to ensure alignment with administration policy priorities. This single executive order suspended billions of dollars in congressionally appropriated funds without submitting the rescission or deferral notices required by the Impoundment Control Act of 1974.

Within days, Elon Musk announced on X (formerly Twitter) that DOGE intended to shut down USAID entirely. DOGE operatives — without security clearances commensurate with their access — entered USAID facilities, accessed classified program data, and directed stop-work orders to implementing partners worldwide. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland ruled in March 2025 that these actions were likely unconstitutional, finding that Musk and DOGE had no legal authority to dismantle a congressionally created agency and had deprived Congress of "its constitutional authority to decide whether, when and how to close down an agency created by Congress."

The sequence of destruction:

**January 24, 2025**: Stop-work orders issued to all USAID grant holders. HIV testing counselors and clinic staff funded by USAID were immediately laid off worldwide.

**January 28, 2025**: Approximately 400 USAID contract employees were laid off.

**February 3, 2025**: Secretary of State Marco Rubio appointed himself Acting Administrator of USAID, announcing its absorption into the State Department — an action taken without congressional authorization.

**February 23, 2025**: The administration announced that 4,700 USAID employees would be placed on administrative leave and 1,600 positions eliminated.

**March 10, 2025**: Secretary Rubio announced that 83% of USAID's program contracts — approximately 5,200 contracts — had been canceled following a six-week review.

**March 28, 2025**: USAID personnel received reduction-in-force notices separating most employees by July 1, 2025, and remaining personnel by September 2, 2025.

**July 1, 2025**: Secretary Rubio formally announced that "USAID will officially cease to implement foreign assistance." The 64-year-old agency was extinguished. The approximately 10% of programs deemed aligned with administration policy were absorbed into a diminished State Department bureau with no specialized development expertise and no independent mandate.

### The Destruction of PEPFAR and the HIV Treatment Crisis

The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) — authorized under 22 U.S.C. § 7601 and constituting the largest international health initiative in history — had by 2025 kept more than 20.6 million people alive on antiretroviral treatment, including 550,000 children. PEPFAR programs operated in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV carries 67% of the global burden.

The January 24 stop-work order froze PEPFAR funding without exemption. Although a limited waiver was issued on February 1, 2025 — purporting to exempt life-saving HIV care and mother-to-child transmission prevention — the waiver's implementation was incoherent. With virtually all USAID personnel placed on administrative leave, implementing partners had no functioning contacts within the agency to navigate waiver compliance. Medications sat in warehouses because USAID-funded supply chains had been severed. Programs collapsed in the gap between the waiver's existence on paper and the operational capacity to execute it.

Real-world data from Mozambique showed that more than 15,000 fewer people started antiretroviral treatment between February and May 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 — a 14% reduction. Peer-reviewed mathematical modeling published in academic journals projects that if PEPFAR funding cuts persist through 2030, HIV incidence will increase by 78%, adding 85,000 infections and 25,000 additional HIV-related deaths in the seven sub-Saharan African countries studied. UNAIDS documented that the U.S. funding freeze jeopardized HIV/AIDS care for the full 20.6 million individuals in PEPFAR-supported programs.

This is not an abstraction. These are people who were receiving treatment, who showed up at clinics, and found the medications gone and the staff dismissed.

### The Elimination of Food Security and Humanitarian Assistance

**What the Trump Administration Did:**

USAID administered approximately $5 billion annually in food assistance, making the United States the world's largest single contributor to global food aid. The Food for Peace program (7 U.S.C. § 1691), the primary legal vehicle for U.S. international food assistance, provided emergency rations in conflict zones and chronically food-insecure regions. The administration terminated these contracts across multiple theaters:

**Afghanistan**: The United States contributed approximately $280 million through USAID annually to Afghan food programs. The Trump administration canceled those contracts in full. According to the United Nations, approximately half the Afghan population depends on humanitarian aid for survival, with more than 3 million people on the brink of starvation as of 2025.

**Haiti**: More than 5.7 million Haitians — over half the population — face acute food insecurity. The loss of U.S. funding forced the World Food Programme to suspend hot meals for recently displaced people and cut monthly rations in half for those facing emergency-level hunger.

**Syria**: The administration terminated approximately $230 million in contracts with WFP and humanitarian organizations operating in Syria, where the population had already suffered years of conflict-related food system collapse.

**Yemen**: U.S. aid reversals in Yemen disrupted food pipelines for a population the United Nations described as experiencing the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The administration briefly reversed some cancellations after the WFP warned of imminent mass casualties.

The World Food Programme projected that U.S. funding cuts would reduce its total resources by 34% compared to 2024 levels, forcing the elimination of food assistance for up to 16.7 million people. WFP announced it would cut its own staff by one-third. The scale of the U.S. withdrawal from global food security has no peacetime precedent.

The administration's claim that food aid was "wasteful" or "ineffective" was contradicted by decades of USAID's own program evaluations, independent academic research, and World Bank studies documenting the effectiveness of food aid in preventing famine mortality, reducing child stunting, and maintaining household income stability in crisis-affected populations. The termination of food security programs was not evidence-based management — it was ideological retrenchment that placed millions of lives at risk to generate a political talking point about foreign aid spending.

### The Destruction of Democracy and Governance Programming

**What the Trump Administration Did:**

USAID democracy, rights, and governance (DRG) programming funded civil society organizations, independent media, election monitors, anti-corruption investigators, rule-of-law reformers, and human rights defenders in more than 120 countries. These programs were terminated at a rate exceeding 97% — the highest cancellation rate of any USAID program category.

More than 1,600 DRG-related grants worth more than $14 billion were terminated. The consequences:

- Organizations documenting human rights abuses in China and North Korea lost all funding.
- Pro-democracy groups in Cuba, Belarus, Myanmar, and Venezuela were defunded.
- Independent media and anti-corruption programs in Ukraine — fighting an active Russian invasion — were cut.
- Human rights defenders at risk of persecution lost U.S. protection grants.
- Internet freedom programs that provided circumvention tools to citizens living under censorship collapsed.
- Election observer missions scheduled for 2025 were canceled, removing U.S. visibility into democratic processes in fragile states.
- Rule-of-law programs supporting judicial independence in Latin America were terminated, ceding ground to organized crime and authoritarian political actors.

The governments that celebrated most loudly were the ones USAID had most constrained. Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and El Salvador all publicly welcomed USAID's destruction, recognizing that the primary organized opposition to their domestic repression had been neutralized. The OECD projected a 9-17% drop in global Official Development Assistance in 2025, with the U.S. withdrawal accelerating a cascade of democratic backsliding in fragile states.

In Ukraine specifically, programs supporting anti-corruption oversight, judicial reform, civil society infrastructure, and independent journalism were terminated at the moment Ukraine's institutional resilience was most critical to sustaining its resistance to Russian aggression. The Center for Strategic and International Studies documented that U.S. democracy and human rights assistance cuts directly undermined governance capacity in countries simultaneously facing military, economic, and information warfare threats from Russia and China.

A Global Democracy Coalition survey of organizations affected by the cuts found that the speed and breadth of terminations prevented transition planning, leaving civil society organizations unable to find alternative funding in time to survive. Organizations that had operated for decades — building relationships with community leaders, training local journalists, monitoring elections — were shut down within weeks. This institutional knowledge cannot be reconstituted quickly. It takes years to rebuild trust networks, establish field presence, and develop the local staff capacity that makes development programming effective.

### The Anti-Corruption Mission Abandoned

**What the Trump Administration Did:**

USAID's anti-corruption programming was among the first casualties of the 2025 freeze. Anti-corruption grants in Ukraine, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Niger, and dozens of other countries were terminated or suspended. Investigative journalism training programs that equipped local reporters to expose corruption were defunded. Transparency and open government programs that built public access to government data were shut down.

The irony is acute: an administration that claimed foreign aid was wasteful and corrupt eliminated the programs specifically designed to reduce waste and corruption in foreign assistance. Independent oversight mechanisms — including government accountability programs, parliamentary strengthening assistance, and civil society watchdog support — were the programs terminated most aggressively.

The consequences extend beyond individual countries. Corruption is the primary driver of aid ineffectiveness, state fragility, and forced migration. Countries with strong anti-corruption institutions retain aid investments; countries without them see aid captured by elites and diverted from intended beneficiaries. By eliminating anti-corruption programming, the administration made future foreign assistance inherently less effective even as it claimed to be improving aid efficiency. The Center for Global Development's analysis estimated that the termination of USAID programs represented approximately $80.5 billion in cuts across State Department and USAID awards combined — a figure that does not include the downstream costs of failed states, pandemic outbreaks, and refugee flows that effective foreign assistance prevents.

### The Collapse of Global Health Security

**What the Trump Administration Did:**

USAID maintained a team of approximately 60 global health security specialists dedicated to outbreak detection, response coordination, and pandemic preparedness — including approximately 10 specialists focused specifically on Ebola surveillance and response. That team was reduced to six total personnel in the early weeks of the Trump administration, with only one Ebola specialist remaining.

The administration canceled contracts addressing Ebola, mpox, measles, tuberculosis, malaria, nutrition assistance, and H5N1 avian influenza. An internal USAID memorandum estimated that the loss of global health security programs alone creates the risk of more than 28,000 new cases of dangerous infectious diseases annually. A termination notice was issued for a Baylor College of Medicine project specifically designed to detect and respond to Ebola outbreaks in Uganda.

The public health logic is unambiguous: infectious diseases identified and contained at their source in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, or Central America do not become pandemics requiring emergency response at U.S. borders. The COVID-19 pandemic cost the United States more than 1 million lives and trillions of dollars. The elimination of the early-warning and rapid-response systems that might have intercepted the next pandemic is not a cost savings — it is a deferred catastrophe.

### The Human Cost

The combined human toll of USAID's destruction:

- **20.6 million** people — including 550,000 children — had their HIV treatment programs jeopardized or disrupted
- **16.7 million** people lost or faced the loss of emergency food assistance through WFP program cuts
- **3 million** Afghans on the brink of starvation with U.S. food contracts canceled
- **5.7 million** Haitians facing acute food insecurity with U.S. aid suspended
- **120 countries** lost U.S.-funded democracy and civil society programming
- **97%** of democracy, human rights, and governance programs were terminated
- **12,000** USAID direct-hire employees were effectively fired or separated, representing approximately 97% of total agency staffing
- **5,200** contracts terminated, eliminating the implementing partner ecosystem built over six decades across more than 100 countries
- **28,000** additional infectious disease cases projected annually from elimination of global health security programs alone
- **$80.5 billion** in total program cuts across USAID and State Department foreign assistance, per Center for Global Development analysis
- **97%** of democracy, human rights, and governance programs terminated — the highest cancellation rate of any USAID program category
- **34%** reduction in WFP projected resources, with knock-on cuts to its own staff and operations
- **14%** fewer new antiretroviral treatment initiations in Mozambique alone in the first four months of the freeze

Senator Bernie Sanders warned these actions would lead "to millions of preventable deaths." USAID's own acting administrator for global health stated that the dismantling "results in the U.S. government's failure to implement critical lifesaving activities." A peer-reviewed study published in a leading public health journal modeled that extending PEPFAR funding cuts through 2030 would produce 85,000 additional HIV infections and 25,000 additional HIV-related deaths in just seven sub-Saharan African countries.

The economic cost of USAID's dismantling extends beyond humanitarian statistics. The International Monetary Fund has documented the relationship between foreign aid effectiveness and economic stability in developing countries. Countries experiencing development program disruption face increased political instability, reduced investment, and accelerated state fragility — conditions that generate the migration flows, security threats, and ungoverned spaces that impose direct costs on the United States. Every dollar USAID spent preventing a famine in the Sahel saved multiples in refugee processing, military stabilization, and emergency humanitarian response. The administration that claimed to be saving money by eliminating USAID was actually deferring far larger expenditures to a later date — and imposing irreversible costs in lost lives in the interim.

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

The President's constitutional authority over foreign affairs does not include the authority to unilaterally abolish congressionally created agencies or impound congressionally appropriated funds. The separation of powers is not optional.

**Article I, Section 9, Clause 7** (the Spending Clause) vests Congress with exclusive authority over appropriations. When Congress funds USAID programs through annual appropriations and authorizing legislation, the executive branch is bound to obligate those funds as directed. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974, enacted after the Nixon administration's systematic defiance of congressional appropriations, codifies this constitutional principle: the President may not refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress without submitting formal rescission requests subject to congressional approval.

**Article I, Section 1** vests all legislative power in Congress. The authority to create, alter, or abolish a federal agency resides in Congress, not the President. USAID was created by statute — the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 — and can only be abolished by statute. The executive order purporting to dissolve USAID and transfer its functions to the State Department was constitutionally unauthorized. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang found in March 2025 that DOGE's dismantling of USAID likely violated the Constitution by depriving Congress of its authority over agency structure.

**The Appointments Clause** (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2) requires Senate confirmation for principal officers of the United States. Elon Musk was neither confirmed by the Senate nor appointed through any constitutionally valid process. His direction of DOGE operatives to enter USAID, access classified information, and issue stop-work orders violated the Appointments Clause. Judge Chuang specifically found that Musk had no legal authority to dismantle the agency.

**Article I, Section 8** vests Congress with the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations — a foundational authority for foreign development assistance as a tool of foreign economic policy.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. § 2151 et seq.)**: The primary statutory authority for USAID's existence and mission. Section 2151 establishes that U.S. foreign assistance shall be carried out "to the maximum extent possible through non-governmental and private voluntary organizations." Section 2381 establishes USAID's organizational authority. The act grants USAID a mission explicitly distinct from State Department diplomatic functions — development expertise, not diplomatic cable traffic. The Foreign Assistance Act's six-decade standing as organizing law for U.S. development practice establishes the presumption that its programs are mandatory unless Congress specifically rescinds them. The executive branch has no authority under this statute to unilaterally terminate programs for ideological rather than programmatic reasons.

**PEPFAR Statute (22 U.S.C. § 7601 et seq.)**: The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act, as amended by the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act (Lugar-Biden Act), mandates specific funding levels and program requirements for HIV treatment, prevention, and care. The administration's decision to freeze PEPFAR funding without congressional authorization violated the mandatory spending provisions of 22 U.S.C. § 7671. PEPFAR's most recent reauthorization established specific minimum treatment targets that the executive branch is required to pursue; the 2025 freeze constituted a unilateral executive branch refusal to implement a congressional mandate.

**Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. § 1691 et seq.)**: Establishes the framework for international food assistance, including Title II emergency food aid administered by USAID. The act requires the obligating of appropriated food aid funds; cancellation of implementing contracts without congressional authorization constituted impoundment in violation of 2 U.S.C. § 683. Title II emergency food assistance is expressly designated as authorized and appropriated to respond to humanitarian emergencies; the executive branch lacks statutory authority to withhold Title II funds from countries experiencing documented food emergencies meeting the statutory threshold of 5 U.S.C. § 1691(c).

**Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.)**: Prohibits the President from withholding congressionally appropriated funds without following formal rescission or deferral procedures requiring congressional notification. The administration's blanket foreign assistance freeze violated this statute. Although the Supreme Court's September 2025 ruling permitted the freeze to stand temporarily on administrative law grounds, the constitutional questions remain contested and the statutory framework remains in force. The next Congress should enact a Strengthened Impoundment Control Act closing the procedural loopholes the Trump administration exploited and restoring the mandatory-spend structure that the Impoundment Control Act originally intended.

**Global Food Security Act of 2016 (22 U.S.C. § 9301 et seq.)**: Requires the President to develop and implement a whole-of-government strategy to address global food insecurity. The administration's cancellation of food security contracts directly violated this statutory mandate. Section 9305 specifically requires the Secretary of State, in coordination with the USAID Administrator, to submit to Congress a Global Food Security Strategy — a mandate the Trump administration ignored.

**Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8))**: Prohibits retaliation against federal employees who disclose illegality or waste. USAID employees who raised objections to illegal stop-work orders and contract cancellations are entitled to statutory protection. The administration's pattern of placing objecting employees on administrative leave and subsequently terminating them constituted systematic violation of these protections. The next administration will direct the Office of Special Counsel to review all USAID-related whistleblower retaliation complaints from 2025 and take appropriate remedial action.

**State Department Basic Authorities Act (22 U.S.C. § 2651 et seq.)**: Governs the organizational structure and authorities of the Department of State. Secretary Rubio's unilateral declaration that USAID would be absorbed into the State Department — without statutory authorization — exceeded his authority under this Act, which does not grant the Secretary power to reorganize statutory agencies by administrative fiat.

**Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. § 3901 et seq.)**: Establishes the rights and protections of Foreign Service Officers, including USAID's Foreign Service workforce. Reduction-in-force actions affecting Foreign Service personnel must comply with the procedural requirements of this Act, including specific notice periods and rights of appeal. Many of the personnel actions taken against USAID Foreign Service Officers in 2025 failed to comply with these statutory requirements and are legally contestable.

### Supreme Court Impoundment Ruling and Legislative Response

The Supreme Court's September 2025 decision permitting the Trump administration to freeze $4 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign aid — over a 5-4 dissent — represents a significant regression in the constitutional law of executive spending authority. The majority's reasoning effectively carved out an administrative law exception to the Impoundment Control Act's mandatory-spend requirements, holding that aid organizations could not use the Administrative Procedure Act to enforce congressionally appropriated spending obligations against the executive branch.

This decision does not end the constitutional debate — it intensifies the legislative imperative. Congress must respond by enacting the Strengthened Impoundment Enforcement Act, creating a direct private cause of action under the Impoundment Control Act that does not depend on APA standing, and establishing congressional standing to enforce impoundment law through the Comptroller General. The decision, as written, creates a roadmap for any future President to impound any congressionally appropriated foreign assistance by the expedient of claiming a foreign policy review — effectively transferring the power of the purse from Congress to the executive on all foreign assistance matters. Congress must close this gap legislatively before the next administration, regardless of party, exploits the same precedent.

### The DOGE Illegality

DOGE's role in USAID's destruction raises distinct legal questions beyond presidential impoundment authority. DOGE operatives who lacked appropriate security clearances accessed classified USAID program data, including information about intelligence-community-adjacent programs in fragile states. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2) requires that formal advisory groups to federal agencies comply with transparency and procedural requirements. DOGE's operation as an informal executive directive body circumventing these requirements constitutes a violation of the Act's procedural mandates.

The Inspector General Act of 1978 requires independent oversight of federal agencies' operations. The Trump administration sidelined USAID's Inspector General, whose staff had been actively reviewing DOGE's access to agency systems and the legality of stop-work orders at the time they were forced out.

Elon Musk's direction of DOGE's USAID operations created a further constitutional infirmity. The Supreme Court's decision in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), affirmed that the structural protections of the separation of powers extend to the exercise of executive authority by officers of the United States. Musk was neither a principal officer confirmed by the Senate nor a properly appointed inferior officer under Article II. His exercise of authority over USAID — including directing personnel actions, access to agency systems, and issuance of operational directives — constituted the exercise of executive power by a private citizen outside any constitutionally valid appointment structure. A February 2026 court order in the American Foreign Service Association litigation directed Musk to sit for deposition regarding his role in directing USAID's dissolution, confirming the ongoing legal accountability for these actions.

The next administration will direct the Department of Justice to conduct a comprehensive legal review of all actions taken by DOGE operatives at USAID from January through July 2025, with particular attention to: unauthorized access to classified information, violations of the Impoundment Control Act, violations of the Appointments Clause, and potential violations of the False Statements Act in any representations made to federal courts regarding DOGE's authority and operations. Where criminal referrals are warranted, the DOJ will make them.

### USAID's Strategic Value — What the Administration Destroyed

Beyond the immediate humanitarian consequences, the destruction of USAID eliminated one of the United States' most cost-effective national security instruments. The entire USAID budget represented approximately 1% of the federal budget — roughly $27 billion annually — yet the return on that investment was measurable in pandemic infections prevented, famines averted, conflicts de-escalated through economic development, and authoritarian governments checked by civil society organizations that U.S. assistance sustained.

Every dollar invested in preventing a pandemic at its source is worth approximately $500 in avoided response costs — a ratio documented by Johns Hopkins and other public health research institutions. The 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, which USAID's rapid response helped contain before it became a global pandemic, would have cost the United States far more than the full USAID annual budget in response costs alone if it had spread to Europe and North America at the scale that early projections suggested.

The strategic return extends to geopolitical competition. China's Belt and Road Initiative has made infrastructure investments across Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America — but without transparency, environmental standards, or anti-corruption conditions. USAID's development programs built relationships, local capacity, and institutional trust that Belt and Road cannot replicate. The administration's decision to eliminate USAID ceded an entire dimension of strategic competition with China — the competition for goodwill, partnership, and institutional relationships in the developing world — to Beijing. No amount of tariff policy or military spending can recover the strategic ground surrendered by the voluntary elimination of America's primary development diplomacy instrument.

## Part III: Comprehensive USAID Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: Restore USAID's Independent Agency Status

The foundational act of restoration is reconstituting USAID as the independent development agency Congress created in 1961. No administrative action by the State Department can substitute for this.

**Day One Executive Order**: The next Democratic President will issue an Executive Order on Day One reconstituting USAID as an independent agency, revoking all Trump-era executive orders, proclamations, and directives that suspended USAID operations, froze foreign assistance funds, or directed USAID's absorption into the State Department. The Order will direct the immediate reinstatement of USAID's website, IT systems, and physical facilities and appoint an Acting Administrator pending Senate confirmation.

**Workforce Restoration**: The Order will direct the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Defense to facilitate the emergency reinstatement of all USAID career Foreign Service Officers, Civil Service employees, and contractors wrongfully separated through non-statutory DOGE directives. Separation actions taken without compliance with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. § 7511 et seq.) are legally void. The administration will offer reinstatement with back pay to all improperly separated employees.

**USAID Statutory Independence Act**: Within the First 100 Days, the administration will submit to Congress the USAID Statutory Independence Act, codifying in permanent statute USAID's existence, independence, and operational autonomy. The Act will prohibit future Presidents from abolishing, merging, or functionally subordinating USAID to the State Department without explicit congressional authorization. It will establish that USAID's Administrator must be a Senate-confirmed principal officer with independent budget authority and direct access to the National Security Council. The Act will further establish minimum staffing levels for USAID's core technical bureaus — Global Health, Food Security, Democracy and Governance, Economic Growth, and Environment and Climate Resilience — that cannot be reduced below threshold levels without congressional approval, preventing any future administration from hollowing out the agency while leaving its statutory shell nominally intact.

**Reconstituting Development Expertise**: USAID's organizational structure will be rebuilt around technical expertise in global health, food security, democracy and governance, economic growth, and climate resilience. The separation between development economics and diplomatic practice — intentionally maintained under USAID's original statutory design — will be restored. Development professionals must not be subordinated to diplomatic cable traffic. The administration will direct USAID to develop a comprehensive workforce plan identifying the specific technical competencies required for each bureau, the current gaps resulting from 2025 terminations, and the targeted hiring strategy to fill those gaps within 24 months.

**Protecting USAID's Institutional Knowledge**: One of the most irreversible consequences of the 2025 dismantling was the loss of institutional knowledge — the career professionals who had spent decades building relationships with partner governments, understanding local political economies, and developing evidence-based programming approaches that actually work. This knowledge cannot be reconstituted from databases or policy documents. The administration will create a USAID Knowledge Recovery Program, tasking the reconstituted agency with conducting structured debriefs with former employees, rebuilding relationship networks with implementing partners and foreign governments, and documenting programmatic lessons learned from the 2025 disruptions to inform future programming. Former USAID employees will be offered consulting contracts under the Federal Acquisition Regulation to support the knowledge recovery process, ensuring that decades of development expertise are captured rather than permanently lost.

**Independence from Political Interference**: The USAID Statutory Independence Act will establish civil service protections for USAID career staff that are explicitly not subject to Schedule F or similar at-will employment reclassification. It will require that any reduction in USAID's workforce exceeding 10% in a 12-month period be preceded by a formal report to Congress documenting the programmatic rationale, a 60-day public comment period, and independent Inspector General review. These provisions directly respond to the 2025 mechanism by which DOGE achieved wholesale workforce elimination — by placing employees on administrative leave en masse and then issuing reduction-in-force notices once the agency had been functionally dismantled. The Act will make this mechanism legally unavailable to future administrations without congressional authorization.

### Reform II: Restore PEPFAR and Global HIV/AIDS Programs

PEPFAR represents the most successful bilateral global health program in human history. Its restoration is non-negotiable.

**Emergency PEPFAR Funding Restoration**: The administration will immediately obligate the full statutory funding authorized under 22 U.S.C. § 7671, including emergency supplemental appropriations to compensate for the 2025 treatment interruptions. Emergency supply chain restoration will be directed through USAID's reconstituted global health office to ensure antiretroviral medications reach patients in Mozambique, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia, and all other PEPFAR program countries within 90 days. The administration will direct the Department of Health and Human Services' CDC Global HIV/AIDS programs to serve as the interim operational bridge for PEPFAR implementation in countries where USAID implementing partner contracts were terminated and cannot be immediately reinstated — ensuring that no patient remains without treatment due to administrative processing delays during the restoration period.

**Immediate Medical Supply Restoration**: The administration will direct USAID, in coordination with the Department of Defense's Defense Logistics Agency, to conduct emergency airlifts of antiretroviral medications to countries where supply chains were severed and medication stockpiles are critically depleted. This is not a hypothetical — real-world reporting from Mozambique and other countries documented medications sitting in warehouses because USAID-funded supply chain staff were dismissed and distribution logistics were non-functional. Emergency supply chain restoration is a Day One priority requiring active operational intervention, not merely contractual reinstatement.

**Treatment Continuity Audit**: USAID will conduct a comprehensive audit within 180 days of reconstitution to identify every individual who lost access to HIV treatment due to the 2025 funding freeze, every child who lost access to mother-to-child transmission prevention services, and every program that requires restart or reconstruction. The audit will inform emergency grant-making to restore disrupted programs and document the full human cost of the 2025 freeze for the historical record.

**Strengthening PEPFAR's Statutory Mandate**: The administration will seek congressional passage of the PEPFAR Permanence and Continuity Act, amending 22 U.S.C. § 7671 to establish a permanent, mandatory minimum annual funding floor below which no executive action may reduce PEPFAR appropriations without concurrent congressional authorization. The Act will require that any modification to PEPFAR's implementing structure provide 180 days notice to Congress with a full impact assessment.

**Addressing the 2025 Treatment Gap's Long-Term Consequences**: The 2025 PEPFAR funding freeze produced not only immediate treatment interruptions but long-term consequences that require active medical management. Interrupted antiretroviral therapy is not medically neutral — it can generate drug-resistant HIV strains that are harder and more expensive to treat, reduce immune function in ways that increase vulnerability to opportunistic infections, and in the worst cases produce viral rebounds that prove fatal. USAID's reconstituted global health office will fund a dedicated HIV Treatment Recovery Program providing enhanced clinical support, viral load monitoring, and drug resistance testing in all countries where treatment interruptions were documented in 2025.

**Integration with Broader Health Systems**: PEPFAR's restoration will be integrated with a broader health systems strengthening agenda — building the laboratory infrastructure, supply chain management capacity, health worker training programs, and health information systems that enable sustainable national HIV responses. USAID will direct not less than 15% of PEPFAR program funds to health systems strengthening activities in each program country, ensuring that the clinical HIV response is embedded in functioning national health systems rather than parallel implementation structures that collapse when U.S. funding is withdrawn.

**Restoring Country Ownership**: PEPFAR will recommit to the principle of country ownership — the transition toward host-country governments taking primary responsibility for their national HIV responses, supported by U.S. technical assistance and transitional funding. This transition will follow epidemiological benchmarks, not political timelines, and will not be used to justify funding cuts in countries that have not yet developed sufficient domestic health system capacity. The 2025 experience demonstrated that the country ownership transition must be managed carefully and with adequate transitional funding — abrupt withdrawal, even from countries with relatively mature national programs, produces immediate treatment disruptions with serious clinical and public health consequences.

### Reform III: Restore Food Security and Humanitarian Assistance

The administration will treat the restoration of food security programming as a humanitarian emergency, not a routine procurement matter.

**Emergency Food Aid Reinstatement**: The administration will direct USAID to issue emergency reinstatement notices within 30 days to implementing partners whose Food for Peace (7 U.S.C. § 1691) contracts were terminated. Emergency bridge funding will be obligated for Afghanistan, Haiti, Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia — countries where USAID documented the most severe consequences of the 2025 contract cancellations.

**WFP Partnership Restoration**: The United States will restore its position as the World Food Programme's largest donor, committing to multi-year funding agreements that enable WFP to plan and staff operations rather than responding to annual budget uncertainty. The administration will negotiate a bilateral framework agreement with WFP establishing minimum U.S. funding commitments and joint accountability mechanisms.

**Food Security Early Warning System**: USAID's Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which the administration disrupted, will be fully restored and expanded to provide real-time food security monitoring in an additional 20 fragile states. Early warning data will be integrated with World Bank food security assessments and FAO monitoring systems through a new U.S.-led Global Food Security Information Platform.

**Local Food Systems Investment**: The administration will shift a portion of U.S. food aid from commodity shipments — which USAID's own research demonstrated can undermine local agricultural markets — to local and regional procurement programs that build host-country agricultural capacity. This approach aligns with evidence-based development practice and serves U.S. strategic interests by reducing long-term aid dependency. The administration will direct USAID to increase local and regional procurement of food assistance from 10% to 25% of total food aid within three years, consistent with the evidence from USAID's own food assistance reform initiatives.

**Agricultural Development Investment**: Beyond emergency food aid, the administration will restore USAID's agricultural development programming — the Feed the Future initiative and its successor programs that invest in smallholder farmer productivity, agricultural market development, nutrition-sensitive agriculture, and climate-smart farming practices. Feed the Future, authorized under the Global Food Security Act of 2016, was a cornerstone of USAID's approach to addressing the root causes of food insecurity rather than merely treating its symptoms. The Trump administration gutted Feed the Future programming along with emergency food aid. Restoration of Feed the Future will prioritize regions where climate change is most severely affecting agricultural productivity — the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, South Asia — and will integrate climate adaptation into all smallholder development programming.

**Nutrition Programming**: USAID's nutrition programming — addressing malnutrition in children under five, stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies — was eliminated in the 2025 cuts. The administration will restore nutrition programming across all major bilateral development portfolios, recognizing that malnutrition in the first 1,000 days of life produces irreversible cognitive and physical developmental consequences that reduce human capital formation and perpetuate intergenerational poverty. USAID's nutrition programs will be integrated with health systems, agricultural development, and WASH programming to address the multisectoral determinants of malnutrition.

### Reform IV: Rebuild Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance Programs

The administration will treat the restoration of democracy and governance programming as a core national security priority.

**Emergency DRG Restoration**: Within 90 days of USAID's reconstitution, the administration will issue emergency grants to civil society organizations whose funding was terminated in 2025. Priority will be given to organizations operating in high-risk environments — Ukraine, Belarus, Myanmar, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, and countries experiencing democratic backsliding as measured by Freedom House indicators. The administration will direct USAID to develop a rapid-response DRG grant mechanism enabling disbursement to pre-vetted organizations within 30 days of a democratic emergency — without waiting for the standard procurement cycle that takes months to complete.

**Ukraine Civil Society Emergency Fund**: The administration will establish a dedicated $500 million fund for Ukrainian civil society, anti-corruption institutions, independent journalism, and rule-of-law programming. This fund will operate in coordination with EU and NATO partner contributions and will be designed to sustain democratic governance infrastructure throughout the duration of Russian military aggression. The Fund will specifically target the anti-corruption ecosystem — supporting the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), the National Agency on Corruption Prevention, and civil society organizations that audit government procurement and monitor public expenditure integrity. Ukraine's post-war reconstruction will require functioning anti-corruption institutions; funding them now is a prerequisite for effective reconstruction accountability later.

**Independent Media Support**: USAID's democracy programs will prioritize independent media sustainability, including digital security training, legal support for journalists facing persecution, and sustainable revenue model development. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) will receive increased funding and a statutory mandate to coordinate with USAID on media support programming in high-priority countries. The administration will direct USAID to develop a specific framework for supporting media sustainability in authoritarian contexts — where advertising markets are controlled, state media dominates, and foreign funding is often criminalized — including digital paywalls, reader-supported journalism models, and diaspora fundraising mechanisms that reduce dependency on U.S. grant funding.

**Anti-Corruption Integration**: Anti-corruption programming will be integrated across all USAID sector portfolios — health, education, food security, infrastructure — rather than siloed within governance programs. The administration will direct USAID to develop joint anti-corruption strategies with the Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs and the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. USAID will develop sector-specific anti-corruption tools for health procurement, education finance, infrastructure contracting, and land administration — the sectors where corruption most directly prevents development resources from reaching intended beneficiaries.

**Human Rights Defender Protection**: USAID will restore and expand its human rights defender protection programs, including emergency relocation support, digital security training, legal assistance, and rapid-response grant mechanisms for defenders facing imminent persecution. The administration will create an interagency human rights defender task force coordinating USAID, State, and DOJ resources. This task force will develop a Human Rights Defender Emergency Protocol enabling the U.S. government to respond to defender persecution within 24 hours — providing emergency visa assistance, digital security support, legal representation, and rapid grant disbursement to cover security and relocation costs.

**Election Security and Democratic Process Support**: USAID will restore its election and political process programming, funding domestic election management body strengthening, voter education, poll worker training, and civil society election monitoring capacity in partner countries. USAID will coordinate with the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to develop a comprehensive electoral assistance framework, and will restore the U.S. commitment to deploying election observer missions through the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and regional bodies. The administration recognizes that free and fair elections are not a peripheral development goal — they are the accountability mechanism through which all other development gains are sustained and protected from reversal by corrupt or authoritarian governments.

### Reform V: Rebuild Global Health Security Capacity

The administration will recognize the elimination of USAID's global health security infrastructure as a national security threat requiring emergency remediation.

**Rapid Reconstitution of GHS Workforce**: USAID will hire an expanded team of global health security specialists — targeting 100 personnel within two years, nearly double the pre-DOGE capacity — with expertise in outbreak detection, epidemiology, laboratory systems, supply chain management, and pandemic preparedness. These positions will be established as permanent career positions protected from future executive personnel actions.

**Ebola and High-Consequence Pathogen Response**: The administration will restore dedicated Ebola surveillance and response programming in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Guinea, and Sierra Leone — the countries with the highest historical Ebola burden. Funding for the Baylor College of Medicine Ebola preparedness program, whose termination notice was issued in 2025, will be restored as a model for the broader restoration of high-consequence pathogen programs.

**H5N1 Avian Influenza Surveillance**: USAID will lead a new international H5N1 surveillance network coordinating with WHO, FAO, and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) to monitor avian influenza in poultry populations, wildlife, and human contacts in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. The United States cannot contain domestic H5N1 risks without upstream surveillance in source regions. The administration will direct USAID's global health security office to develop a specific H5N1 spillover prevention and early detection framework within 90 days of reconstitution, coordinating with CDC's international activities and the State Department's health attaché network.

**Global Health Security Agenda Recommitment**: The United States will recommit to and lead the Global Health Security Agenda — the multilateral framework for building country capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. The administration will seek a permanent U.S. contribution to GHS Agenda trust funds sufficient to support Joint External Evaluation programs in 50 additional countries over five years. The United States will use its leadership in the GHS Agenda to push for binding international commitments to minimum national pandemic preparedness standards, building on the International Health Regulations framework under the WHO Constitution to create enforceable accountability mechanisms for countries that fail to maintain basic surveillance and response capacity.

**One Health Integration**: USAID's health security programs will integrate the One Health framework — recognizing the interconnection of human, animal, and environmental health — across all disease surveillance and response programming. The PREDICT program, which monitored animal-to-human pathogen spillover in biodiversity hotspots and was canceled by the first Trump administration, will be reconstituted and expanded. The reconstituted PREDICT program will specifically focus on surveillance in regions experiencing accelerated deforestation and agricultural encroachment into previously wild habitats — the environmental conditions most strongly associated with novel pathogen emergence and spillover events.

**Laboratory Strengthening**: USAID's global health security investments will prioritize laboratory strengthening in partner countries — building the in-country diagnostic capacity that enables outbreak detection at the source rather than after international spread. USAID will fund national reference laboratory upgrades in 30 partner countries, providing equipment, quality management system support, and scientist training to enable detection of priority pathogens including Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, SARS-like coronaviruses, and novel influenza strains. Strong in-country laboratory capacity is the foundation of the global health security architecture; without it, surveillance systems produce no actionable intelligence.

### Reform VI: Climate Resilience and Sustainable Development

Climate change is the force multiplier underlying every development challenge USAID addresses. Food insecurity, forced displacement, disease emergence, and political instability all track with climate-driven environmental stress. USAID will restore and expand its climate programming accordingly.

**Climate Adaptation Assistance**: USAID will restore all climate adaptation programs terminated in 2025 and submit a five-year Climate Resilience Investment Plan allocating not less than 30% of USAID's bilateral development assistance to climate adaptation programming. Priority regions will include the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Small Island Developing States — geographies where climate impacts are existential threats, not policy abstractions. The administration will direct USAID to develop climate vulnerability assessments for all 40 bilateral partner countries and integrate those assessments into sector programming across food security, water, health, and infrastructure.

**Energy Transition Support**: USAID's Power Africa program — which the Trump administration severely reduced — will be restored and expanded with a mandate to accelerate renewable energy deployment across sub-Saharan Africa. Power Africa will work in partnership with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to mobilize private capital for grid-scale solar, wind, and energy storage projects, with a goal of delivering clean electricity access to 50 million additional people by 2030. The administration will direct USAID and DFC to develop joint climate investment frameworks with multilateral development banks — the World Bank, African Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank — leveraging U.S. bilateral programming to mobilize multilateral capital at scale.

**Water Security Programming**: USAID's water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs — which the Trump administration also cut — will be restored and scaled. Safe water access and sanitation infrastructure are foundational to all other development outcomes: children cannot learn when they are sick from waterborne disease, women cannot participate in the workforce when they spend hours daily collecting water, and public health systems cannot function without basic WASH infrastructure. USAID will develop a Water Security Initiative targeting sustainable clean water access for 25 million additional people in water-stressed regions within five years. The Initiative will prioritize utility strengthening — building the operational and financial management capacity of municipal water authorities — over infrastructure investment alone, addressing the fundamental governance failure that causes newly built water systems to fall into disrepair within years of construction. USAID will coordinate the Water Security Initiative with World Bank water sector operations and African Development Bank infrastructure financing to maximize the leverage of U.S. bilateral programming with multilateral capital.

**Gender Equity and Women's Empowerment**: The Trump administration specifically targeted USAID's gender equity programming — eliminating the Office of Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment as Project 2025 recommended. The next administration will restore this office, recognizing that gender equity programming is not ideological advocacy — it is evidence-based development practice. Investments in girls' education produce the highest returns of any education investment. Women's economic empowerment generates GDP growth that exceeds the investment cost by multiples. Reducing gender-based violence reduces healthcare costs, increases workforce participation, and improves child development outcomes. USAID's gender integration policy will be restored across all sector portfolios, with mandatory gender analysis required for all program designs and gender-disaggregated reporting required for all performance assessments.

**Climate Migration and Displacement**: USAID will establish a dedicated Climate Migration and Displacement program to support communities and host governments managing climate-driven population movements. The program will coordinate with the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration and with UNHCR to address the full displacement cycle from early warning to durable solutions. The administration recognizes that managed, supported migration is far less destabilizing than chaotic forced displacement driven by food system collapse or extreme weather events without prior planning.

### Reform VII: Local Partner Capacity and Aid Architecture Reform

Sustainable development requires building host-country capacity, not perpetuating implementing partner dependency. The 2025 dismantling revealed a critical structural vulnerability: by concentrating U.S. development expertise within Washington-based implementing organizations rather than building it within host-country institutions, USAID created a system that could be collapsed by executive action with devastating speed. The next administration will reform the aid architecture to ensure that development capacity is embedded in countries and communities, not subject to Washington political risk.

**Localization Agenda**: USAID will adopt and implement a binding localization policy — directing that not less than 25% of its program funding reach local organizations in partner countries as prime implementers by Year 2, increasing to 40% by Year 4. This policy reverses the historical concentration of USAID contracts in a small number of large Washington-based implementing organizations and builds the indigenous institutional capacity required for development sustainability. Localization is not merely a development best practice — it is a risk management strategy. Programs embedded in local institutions are not subject to elimination by U.S. executive action.

**Local Organization Capacity Building**: USAID will fund a dedicated Local Systems Support Initiative providing organizational development grants, financial management training, and compliance capacity building to local civil society organizations in 40 partner countries — enabling them to successfully compete for and manage direct U.S. government funding. The Initiative will provide multi-year core support grants to high-performing local organizations, enabling institutional stability rather than the grant-by-grant uncertainty that currently undermines organizational development planning.

**Implementing Partner Accountability**: USAID will strengthen oversight of large implementing partners through enhanced audit requirements, program effectiveness reporting, and competitive recompetition processes. The administration will reform USAID's competitive bidding processes to reduce barriers to entry for smaller and non-traditional implementing organizations, including faith-based organizations, community foundations, and universities. All implementing partner contracts above $10 million will require annual public performance reporting through USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse. USAID will conduct a comprehensive audit of the implementing partner ecosystem — examining which organizations received the most USAID funding over the past decade, what results they achieved, and whether competitive procurement processes were functioning effectively. This audit will inform a reformed procurement system that rewards performance and increases competition.

**The Sub-Award and Local Organization Funding Gap**: The localization agenda requires addressing a structural gap in USAID's procurement system: most local organizations cannot qualify as prime recipients of U.S. government funding because they cannot meet the financial management, compliance, and audit requirements designed for large international NGOs. USAID will establish a Local Organization Accreditation Program — a streamlined compliance certification process designed for organizations with annual budgets under $5 million — enabling local civil society groups, community foundations, and research institutions to receive USAID prime awards without the compliance infrastructure that only large international organizations can maintain. The program will provide technical assistance to local organizations seeking accreditation, covering financial management systems, programmatic reporting, and audit preparation.

**Coordination with Multilateral Partners**: The Trump administration's withdrawal from multilateral development institutions — including reduced U.S. engagement with the World Bank, regional development banks, and UN development agencies — compounded the damage from bilateral program cuts. The next administration will restore full U.S. engagement with multilateral development institutions, recognizing that U.S. bilateral programming is most effective when coordinated with multilateral frameworks that provide complementary resources, country systems engagement, and convening authority that no bilateral donor can replicate alone. USAID will develop joint country strategies with the World Bank Group in all major bilateral partner countries, ensuring U.S. bilateral investments are mutually reinforcing with multilateral programs.

### Reform IX: Restoring Economic Growth and Private Sector Development

USAID's economic growth programs — trade and investment promotion, financial inclusion, workforce development, entrepreneurship support, and regulatory reform assistance — were cut alongside humanitarian and governance programs in 2025. These programs addressed the root causes of poverty and state fragility by creating the economic conditions for sustainable development. Their restoration is a strategic priority.

**Trade and Investment Facilitation**: USAID's trade facilitation programs reduced customs clearance times, improved sanitary and phytosanitary standards compliance, and reduced non-tariff barriers in partner countries — making it easier for U.S. companies to access emerging markets and for partner country exporters to reach global supply chains. These programs generated measurable trade flows and private sector investment that far exceeded their program costs. The administration will restore trade facilitation programming with particular attention to the Indo-Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa, where U.S. trade and investment interests align with development objectives. USAID's trade programs will be coordinated with the U.S. Trade Representative's office and the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration to ensure that USAID's trade capacity building investments create market access conditions that American exporters can then exploit — aligning development assistance with domestic economic interests in a manner that builds bipartisan support for the foreign assistance enterprise.

**Financial Inclusion**: USAID's financial inclusion programs — supporting mobile money infrastructure, microfinance institution capacity, small and medium enterprise lending, and digital financial services — enabled millions of people in partner countries to access formal financial services for the first time. Financial inclusion is the foundation of economic growth in developing economies: without access to savings, credit, and insurance, smallholder farmers cannot invest in productivity, small businesses cannot expand, and families cannot buffer against shocks. The administration will restore financial inclusion programming in coordination with the DFC and Treasury Department's Office of Technical Assistance.

**Workforce Development and Education**: USAID's higher education partnerships, vocational training programs, and STEM education investments built human capital in partner countries that attracted private sector investment and enabled economic diversification. These programs produced USAID-supported graduates who became health sector leaders, public servants, entrepreneurs, and technical professionals in their home countries. The administration will restore workforce development programming, with particular attention to women's economic empowerment — both because gender equity is a development objective in itself and because women's economic participation is among the strongest predictors of overall economic growth. USAID's higher education partnerships — including the Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research program and bilateral university linkages — will be restored, recognizing that the next generation of scientists, engineers, economists, and public health professionals in developing countries represents the human capital investment that will ultimately produce self-sustaining development and reduce the need for ongoing foreign assistance. These programs also create enduring people-to-people connections between the United States and partner countries that diplomacy alone cannot achieve.

**The Strategic Investment Case**: The Congressional Research Service, the RAND Corporation, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies have all produced analyses documenting that U.S. foreign assistance spending generates strategic returns — in alliance building, access, influence, and crisis prevention — that exceed their program costs by substantial multiples when calculated against the alternative costs of military intervention, refugee processing, pandemic response, and post-conflict reconstruction. A recent RAND study estimated that every dollar invested in conflict prevention saves approximately $16 in subsequent conflict management costs. USAID's economic growth, governance, and stability programs are precisely the upstream investments in conflict prevention that reduce the demand for more expensive downstream interventions. The next administration will ensure that this evidence base is integrated into congressional presentations for foreign assistance appropriations — making the case for USAID not as humanitarian charity but as strategic investment with a documented return.

**Performance-Based Programming Reform**: USAID will restructure its programming model to more rigorously apply evidence of effectiveness. Programs that demonstrably achieve their stated objectives will receive sustained and increased funding. Programs that fail to demonstrate measurable impact will be redesigned or replaced — not based on political ideology but based on rigorous program evaluation. USAID's Bureau for Policy, Resources, and Performance will be restored to full capacity and given an expanded mandate to conduct independent impact evaluations of all programs above $25 million and to publish those evaluations publicly through the Development Experience Clearinghouse. The administration will direct USAID to develop a tiered evidence framework — similar to the Department of Education's What Works Clearinghouse — rating program models based on the strength of evidence supporting their effectiveness. This approach will produce better development outcomes and stronger congressional and public support for the foreign assistance enterprise by demonstrating accountability for results.

**International Development Finance Corporation Coordination**: The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) — established under the BUILD Act of 2018 — provides risk insurance, loans, and equity investments to catalyze private sector investment in developing countries. USAID and DFC will develop integrated country strategies ensuring that USAID's grant-funded technical assistance and governance programming creates the enabling conditions for DFC private sector mobilization. In fragile states, USAID programs that strengthen rule of law, reduce corruption, and develop skilled workforces make private investment viable — without USAID's upstream work, DFC investments face higher risk and lower returns. The Trump administration's dismantling of USAID therefore also undermines DFC's effectiveness, reducing the United States' capacity to mobilize private capital for development in competition with Chinese state-directed infrastructure investment.

### Reform VIII: Restoring U.S. Humanitarian Leadership

The United States has been the world's largest humanitarian donor throughout the post-World War II era — not because of altruism alone but because humanitarian leadership serves U.S. interests. Countries that experience acute humanitarian crises without external support generate refugee flows, political instability, pandemic conditions, and state fragility that directly threaten U.S. security interests. The Trump administration's withdrawal from humanitarian leadership created a vacuum that no other donor can fill and that will generate strategic consequences for decades.

**Reconstituting the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance**: USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) — which coordinates disaster response, emergency food aid, humanitarian logistics, and disaster risk reduction — was devastated by the 2025 workforce reductions. The administration will restore BHA to full operational capacity, with a particular focus on restoring the Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) that can deploy within 24 hours to major natural disasters and conflict emergencies. Pre-positioned emergency supplies, logistics frameworks, and field coordination capacity will be restored in all major geographic theaters. BHA will be given a standing emergency reserve fund — the Rapid Humanitarian Response Fund — enabling immediate deployment of up to $100 million in humanitarian assistance within 48 hours of a declared emergency, without waiting for supplemental appropriations or routine contracting processes. This rapid-response capability — which the 2025 dismantling eliminated — is the difference between catching a humanitarian crisis before it becomes a famine and responding after preventable deaths have already occurred.

**Refugee and Internally Displaced Person Programs**: USAID's refugee assistance programs — supporting UNHCR, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and bilateral partners in refugee camps and displacement settings — were severely cut in 2025. The administration will restore full U.S. contributions to refugee assistance, recognizing that failing to support refugee populations in host countries generates migration pressure and political destabilization that ultimately reaches U.S. borders and those of U.S. allies. The United States will restore its position as UNHCR's largest bilateral donor and develop a five-year refugee response partnership framework with UNHCR, WFP, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) that provides multi-year funding commitments enabling operational planning rather than year-to-year crisis management. The framework will specifically address the growing population of climate-displaced individuals who do not qualify for refugee protection under the 1951 Refugee Convention but who require international humanitarian support — developing a new complementary protection framework in coordination with the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.

**Protecting Humanitarian Workers**: The 2025 USAID dismantling left humanitarian field workers — employed by implementing partners in conflict zones and crisis-affected countries — without emergency support structures when their contracts were abruptly terminated. Some were stranded in high-risk locations without evacuation support, with no functioning U.S. government contact to assist them. The administration will establish a Humanitarian Worker Safety Protocol requiring that all USAID implementing partner contracts include provisions for orderly transition and, where necessary, evacuation support for field workers in high-risk environments before contract termination takes effect. No humanitarian worker should be abandoned in a conflict zone because a stop-work order was issued from Washington without regard for field conditions.

**Disaster Risk Reduction**: The administration will expand USAID's pre-crisis investment in disaster risk reduction — building seismic-resistant housing, early flood warning systems, cyclone shelters, drought-resistant agricultural practices, and community preparedness capacity in disaster-prone regions. Every dollar invested in disaster risk reduction saves approximately $7 in disaster response costs, according to USAID's own analysis. The Trump administration eliminated this programming; the next administration will restore and scale it as a cost-effective investment in crisis prevention.

**The Humanitarian-Development Nexus**: The next administration will direct USAID to implement a fully integrated humanitarian-development-peace nexus approach — recognizing that emergency humanitarian response, longer-term development programming, and conflict prevention and peacebuilding are not separate activities requiring separate bureaucratic structures, but interconnected dimensions of a single integrated response to fragile and crisis-affected states. Countries that receive only emergency food aid without accompanying development investment do not become food-secure — they become permanently dependent on emergency assistance. USAID's programming in fragile and crisis-affected states will be designed to simultaneously meet immediate humanitarian needs, rebuild food systems and health infrastructure, and address the governance failures and economic exclusion that drive both humanitarian vulnerability and political conflict.

---

## Conclusion: The Cost of Absence

The United States does not have the luxury of withdrawal from global development and humanitarian leadership. The choice is not between engagement and non-engagement — it is between organized, principled engagement through institutions like USAID and the chaotic consequences of disengagement: pandemics that spread to American cities, famine-driven migration crises that arrive at American borders, authoritarian governments that fill the diplomatic and economic vacuum, and terrorist organizations that recruit in the development-deficit communities that USAID programs previously served.

The Founders understood that the United States could not remain secure in an ungoverned world. Alexander Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 11 that American commerce and strategic interests required engagement with the international system, not retreat from it. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 reflects six decades of bipartisan consensus that American global leadership is in America's interest — that the development of stable, prosperous, democratic partner states creates the international order in which American democracy and American commerce thrive. That consensus was built by Presidents of both parties — Eisenhower who established Point Four, Kennedy who created USAID, Reagan who made PEPFAR's predecessor programs a Republican foreign policy priority, and Bush who launched PEPFAR itself in 2003 as the most ambitious bilateral health initiative in American history.

The Trump administration's destruction of USAID was not fiscal conservatism. The entire USAID budget represented approximately 1% of federal spending. What was eliminated was not wasteful — it was strategic. The lives it cost are real. The pandemics it may enable are real. The authoritarian governments it empowered are real. The strategic position the United States has ceded to China in the developing world is real. The next administration will not merely restore what was destroyed — it will build an institution more resilient, more effective, more locally embedded, and more constitutionally protected than what existed before. The USAID Statutory Independence Act will ensure that no future President — of any party — can repeat the destruction of 2025 by executive fiat. The Strengthened Impoundment Enforcement Act will ensure that Congress's power of the purse over foreign assistance is never again nullified by administrative law maneuvering. The work begins on Day One. The case for doing it is not ideological — it is strategic, humanitarian, and constitutional. These are American lives at stake. These are American interests at stake. The United States must lead.
