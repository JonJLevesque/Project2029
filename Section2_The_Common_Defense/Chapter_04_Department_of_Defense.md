# Chapter 4: Department of Defense

## Executive Summary

The Department of Defense stands at the heart of American democracy's civil-military compact: professional military forces under firm civilian control, defending the Constitution rather than any individual leader. Project 2025 shattered this compact by politicizing military leadership, tolerating extremism in the ranks, threatening to deploy troops against Americans, and undermining military justice. This chapter outlines comprehensive reforms to restore civilian control, eliminate extremism, reform military justice, revitalize alliances, and ensure the military serves democracy—not threatens it.

The stakes are existential. A politicized military enables authoritarian rule. An apolitical professional military defending constitutional governance is democracy's ultimate safeguard. These reforms ensure the Department of Defense fulfills its constitutional mission: providing for the common defense while strengthening, not threatening, democratic governance.

**Key Reforms**:
- Restore firm civilian control and depoliticize military leadership
- Comprehensively combat extremism in the ranks with zero tolerance
- Reform military justice system (sexual assault, racial disparities, due process)
- Restore diversity and inclusion as military strength
- Realign $850B budget away from waste toward real needs
- Address climate change as threat multiplier requiring military adaptation
- Revitalize NATO and Indo-Pacific alliances damaged by Project 2025
- Improve service member quality of life, morale, and professional development

**Constitutional Principle**: The military defends the Constitution, not presidents. Civilian control is non-negotiable. Political loyalty has no place in professional military service.

## Part I: Project 2025 Damage Assessment - The Politicization of Defense

### The Assault on Civilian-Military Relations

Project 2025's most dangerous legacy may be its systematic politicization of the Department of Defense. The professional military ethic—loyalty to Constitution over president, apolitical service, truth-telling to civilian leaders—was replaced with political loyalty tests, ideological conformity, and personal fealty to the president.

#### 1. Political Loyalty Tests for Senior Officers

**What Project 2025 Did**:
- Removed or forced retirement of generals and admirals who provided professional military advice contradicting political preferences
- Promoted officers based on political reliability rather than military competence
- Required public statements of political loyalty from Joint Chiefs
- Pressured military leaders to endorse partisan political positions
- Retaliated against officers who testified truthfully to Congress

**Specific Examples**:
- Joint Chiefs Chairman removed for refusing to support domestic deployment of active duty troops against protesters
- Multiple four-star generals forced into early retirement for professional advice on Afghanistan withdrawal, climate change, or extremism concerns
- Political appointees placed in previously career military positions throughout Pentagon
- Officer promotion boards influenced by political considerations
- Inspector General investigations into dissenting officers

**Impact on Military Professionalism**:
- Destroyed trust between civilian and military leadership
- Created incentive for officers to tell leaders what they want to hear, not military truth
- Undermined professional military advice to civilian decision-makers
- Damaged officer corps morale and retention
- Set dangerous precedent for future administrations

#### 2. Weaponization of Military Against Americans

**Threats and Planning**:
Project 2025 contemplated and in some cases executed plans to use active duty military forces against American civilians exercising First Amendment rights:

**Insurrection Act Abuse Planning**:
- Drafted executive orders to invoke Insurrection Act against protests
- Pre-positioned active duty military units near protest sites
- Developed targeting of "Antifa" and other political movements
- Planned federal takeovers of cities based on partisan control
- Ignored Posse Comitatus Act restrictions on domestic military use

**June 2025 Lafayette Square**:
- Active duty military units deployed to D.C. during protests
- National Guard federalized for political purposes
- Military helicopters used for crowd intimidation (low-altitude flights)
- Chairman of Joint Chiefs forced to participate in political photo op
- Secretary of Defense pressured to support domestic troop deployment

**Continued Threats**:
- Regular threats to deploy military to cities with Democratic mayors
- Use of military facilities and personnel for political events
- Blurring of line between military and law enforcement
- Military involvement in immigration enforcement beyond support role
- Planning for martial law scenarios in contested election

**Constitutional Violations**:
- Posse Comitatus Act (18 USC § 1385) restricts military domestic law enforcement
- First Amendment protections for protesters
- Insurrection Act requires actual rebellion or insurrection, not political disagreement
- Military oath is to Constitution, not suppression of American citizens
- Federalism principles limit federal military intervention

#### 3. Extremism in the Ranks - A Growing Threat

**The Data**:
- Pentagon reports identified 450+ service members and veterans involved in January 6 Capitol attack
- SPLC documented increased white supremacist recruitment targeting military personnel
- Military justice system prosecuted record numbers of extremism-related cases
- Unit climate surveys showed increased racial/ethnic tension
- Exit interviews cited extremist climates as reason for leaving service

**Project 2025's Failures**:
Despite mounting evidence, Project 2025 administration:
- Eliminated DoD extremism screening programs (claimed they were "woke")
- Ended training on recognizing extremist recruitment
- Disbanded diversity and inclusion offices
- Resisted FBI sharing of extremist watchlists with DoD
- Provided political cover for extremist-adjacent groups
- Ignored warnings from military law enforcement and counterintelligence

**Types of Extremism Present**:
- White supremacist groups (Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, III Percenters)
- Accelerationist violence advocates
- Sovereign citizen extremists
- Militia movement members
- Q-Anon conspiracy adherents
- Anti-government extremists

**Why Military is Targeted by Extremists**:
- Combat training and weapons skills
- Tactical knowledge
- Legitimacy and credibility
- Access to installations and information
- Recruitment opportunities within units
- Veteran community networks

**Impact on Unit Cohesion and Readiness**:
- Undermined trust among service members of different backgrounds
- Created hostile climate for minorities, women, LGBTQ+ personnel
- Damaged recruitment in communities targeted by extremists
- International embarrassment and ally concerns
- Compromised security through extremist infiltration
- Eroded professional military culture

#### 4. Military Justice System Failures

**Sexual Assault Epidemic**:
Despite decades of promised reforms, sexual assault and harassment remained endemic:

**By the Numbers (2025-2028)**:
- Estimated 25,000+ sexual assaults annually (based on anonymous surveys)
- Only 7,000 reported (73% never report due to fear of retaliation)
- Conviction rate: ~15% of reports
- Retaliation rate against survivors: ~60%
- Command climate remains hostile to survivors
- Professional and personal costs deter reporting

**System Failures**:
- Chain of command control over prosecution decisions
- Commanders often side with accused (especially if senior or high-performer)
- Inadequate investigation resources and training
- Survivor treatment often amounts to re-traumatization
- Weak sentences even when convicted
- Lack of independent prosecutors
- Good old boys network protects offenders

**Racial Justice Failures**:
Military justice system exhibits systemic racial disparities:

**Disparities in UCMJ Enforcement**:
- Black service members 2.5x more likely to face court-martial than white counterparts
- Hispanic service members 1.8x more likely
- More severe charges and sentences for minority service members
- Implicit bias in commander discretion
- Lack of diversity in JAG corps and military judiciary
- Historical failure to address discrimination

**Due Process Concerns**:
- Limited right to counsel (often overburdened military defenders)
- Command influence on courts-martial outcomes
- Speedy trial violations
- Limited discovery rights compared to civilian criminal justice
- Appeal rights narrower than civilian courts
- Clemency process politicized

#### 5. Diversity and Inclusion Rollback

**Project 2025's Assault on Diversity**:
Framed as eliminating "woke" policies, Project 2025 systematically dismantled programs that made military stronger through diversity:

**Programs Eliminated**:
- Diversity and inclusion training (all levels)
- Unconscious bias awareness for promotion boards
- Mentorship programs for underrepresented groups
- Outreach to minority communities for recruitment
- Women in combat integration support
- LGBTQ+ service member protections
- Religious accommodation processes

**Justifications Used**:
- "Woke military" propaganda
- Claims diversity undermines readiness (opposite of evidence)
- "Merit over diversity" false dichotomy
- "Political correctness" attacks
- Social media campaigns against "DEI"

**Actual Impact**:
- Recruitment declined, especially in diverse communities
- Retention of diverse officers plummeted
- Hostile climate for minorities increased
- Unit cohesion weakened (not strengthened as claimed)
- International reputation damage
- Loss of talent military cannot afford to lose

**Evidence Diversity Strengthens Military**:
- More diverse teams make better decisions (DoD's own studies)
- Reflects nation's diversity (military should look like America)
- Improves cultural competency for global operations
- Expands talent pool for recruitment
- Strengthens alliance relationships
- Enhances legitimacy domestically and internationally

#### 6. Impact on Readiness, Morale, and Recruiting

**Recruitment Crisis**:
By 2028, all services missed recruitment goals:
- Army: 75% of goal
- Navy: 82% of goal
- Marines: 88% of goal
- Air Force: 91% of goal

**Reasons**:
- Politicization driving away families with military tradition
- Extremism concerns
- Sexual assault epidemic
- Low pay and poor quality of life
- Political attacks on military by same leaders claiming to support it
- COVID mismanagement in military
- Social media exposure of problems

**Retention Crisis**:
Mid-career officers and senior NCOs leaving at historic rates:
- Captains and majors (O-3/O-4): 35% leaving at end of obligation
- Senior NCOs (E-7 to E-9): 25% leaving when eligible

**Reasons for Leaving**:
- Political leadership distrust
- Extremism toleration
- Sexual assault/harassment climate
- Family separation stress
- Better civilian opportunities
- Erosion of professional military culture
- Exhaustion from high operational tempo

**Morale Crisis**:
Surveys showed plummeting morale:
- Job satisfaction: All-time lows
- Confidence in senior leadership: 35% (down from 65%)
- "Would recommend military service": 48% (down from 75%)
- Spouse satisfaction: Critical factor in retention, also plummeting
- Reenlistment intentions: Down across all services

**Readiness Implications**:
- Undermanned units
- Training gaps
- Experience drain (mid-career departures)
- Equipment maintenance suffered
- Deployment stress increased
- Combat effectiveness questioned

#### 7. Alliance Damage

**NATO Undermined**:
- Public threats to leave NATO
- Refusal to affirm Article 5 commitment
- Demands for "protection payments"
- Accommodations to Russia
- Undermining Ukraine support
- Eastern European allies terrified

**Indo-Pacific Alliances Strained**:
- Japan and South Korea questioned U.S. reliability
- Philippines reconsidered basing agreements
- Australia concerned about AUKUS
- Taiwan deterrence weakened
- Regional hedging toward China

**International Reputation**:
- Allies planning for U.S. unreliability
- Adversaries emboldened
- Multilateral cooperation difficult
- Intelligence sharing concerns
- Joint operations strained

## Part II: Constitutional and Democratic Principles

### The Civil-Military Compact in American Democracy

The Founders understood standing armies as potential threats to liberty. Their solution: firm civilian control balanced with professional military culture serving Constitution, not individuals.

**Constitutional Foundation**:

**Article I, Section 8** (Congress):
- Power to declare war
- Power to raise and support armies
- Power to provide and maintain a navy
- Power to make rules for government and regulation of military
- Power over militia

**Article II, Section 2** (President):
- Commander-in-Chief of Army, Navy, and militia when federalized
- Commission officers with Senate consent

**Key Principles**:
1. **Divided control**: Congress raises and rules military; President commands
2. **Civilian supremacy**: President (civilian) commands military
3. **Congressional authorization**: War requires congressional declaration
4. **Limited standing army**: Founders feared permanent military
5. **Militia system**: Citizen soldiers, not professional warrior class

**Historical Development**:

**Washington's Precedent**:
George Washington established the principle: military serves nation, not leader. He:
- Refused to use military for political purposes
- Rejected calls to become king
- Resigned commission to return power to civilians
- Established civilian control norm

**Civil War Lessons**:
- Importance of military loyalty to Constitution over states
- Dangers of military involved in domestic politics
- Reconstruction's military occupation challenges

**World Wars and Cold War**:
- Professional officer corps development
- Permanent standing military necessity
- Increased civilian control mechanisms
- Joint Chiefs system
- Defense Department unification

**Recent Challenges**:
- Endless wars without congressional authorization
- Erosion of congressional war powers
- Increased executive military authority
- "Forever wars" straining all-volunteer force
- Politicization pressures

### Apolitical Military Service

The professional military ethic demands political neutrality:

**The Oath**:
Every service member swears:
> "I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice."

**Key Elements**:
- Oath is to Constitution FIRST
- President's orders are lawful only if constitutional and legal
- Duty to refuse illegal orders
- No personal loyalty to president
- Professional obligations over political preferences

**Apolitical Standards**:
- No partisan political activity while in uniform
- No political endorsements
- No attendance at political rallies in uniform
- Vote privately (encouraged but private)
- Professional advice regardless of political implications
- Truth-telling to civilian leaders

**Why Apolitical Military Matters**:
- Maintains public trust across political spectrum
- Ensures military serves nation, not party
- Prevents military coups
- Supports peaceful transfer of power
- Protects professional military advice
- Preserves military effectiveness

**Violations Under Project 2025**:
- Officers required to endorse political positions
- Political events featuring uniformed military
- Retaliation against officers for professional advice
- Promotion based on political loyalty
- Use of military as political props

### Limits on Domestic Military Use

**Posse Comitatus Act (18 USC § 1385)**:
Since 1878, federal military cannot enforce domestic law except as authorized by Constitution or Congress:

> "Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both."

**Purpose**:

President may deploy military domestically only when:
- State requests assistance (§ 251)
- Actual insurrection prevents execution of federal law (§ 252)
- Insurrection, domestic violence, or conspiracy obstructs federal law (§ 253)
- Insurrection prevents protection of constitutional rights (§ 254)

**Requirements**:
- Actual rebellion or insurrection (not protests)
- State inability to handle situation
- Presidential proclamation ordering dispersal
- Last resort (not first response)
- Congressional notification

**Project 2025's Abuse Planning**:
- Conflated protests with insurrection
- Ignored state objections

- First resort, not last
- Political targeting of Democratic jurisdictions

### International Law and Rules of War

U.S. military bound by:

- Article II, Section 2: President as Commander-in-Chief
- First Amendment: Service member rights balanced with military discipline
- Fifth Amendment: Due process in military justice
- Fourteenth Amendment: Equal protection, including in military service

**Congressional Authority:**
"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 14)

Congress has plenary authority to regulate military, including justice system, personnel policies, and organization—limited only by other constitutional provisions (due process, equal protection, etc.)

## Conclusion: Defending Democracy by Defending Defenders

The Department of Defense exists to provide for the common defense—defending American territory, interests, and values. But Project 2025 turned this mission on its head, politicizing the military, tolerating extremism, threatening deployment against Americans, and undermining the civil-military compact foundational to democracy.

These reforms restore the Department of Defense to its constitutional mission:

**An apolitical professional military** serving the Constitution, providing unvarnished advice to civilian leaders, and refusing illegal orders.

**Civilian control firmly established**, not through political loyalty tests but through constitutional authority and professional norms.

**Extremism eradicated** because it violates the oath, undermines unit cohesion, and threatens national security.

**Justice that is actually just**, protecting victims, treating all service members equally, and maintaining due process.

**Diversity as strength**, expanding the talent pool, enhancing decision-making, and ensuring the military reflects America.

**Resources aligned with priorities**, investing in people and readiness rather than waste and legacy systems.

**Climate adaptation** because climate change threatens installations, operations, and global stability.

**Alliances revitalized** because American security depends on partners who share democratic values.

**Service members and families respected**, adequately compensated, and provided quality of life they have earned through their service and sacrifice.

The military is not the enemy of democracy—it is democracy's defender. But only when firmly under civilian control, committed to constitutional oath, and serving national interest rather than political interests.

Project 2025 tested this compact. It bent but did not break. These reforms ensure it never breaks, that the Department of Defense remains America's ultimate safeguard against foreign threats and, just as importantly, never becomes a tool of domestic oppression.

Service members swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. These reforms ensure they can keep that oath—and that their oath protects democracy rather than threatens it.

The common defense requires a democratic defense—military forces defending democracy abroad and strengthening democracy at home. These reforms deliver both.
