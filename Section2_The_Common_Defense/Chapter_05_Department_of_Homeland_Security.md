# Chapter 5: Department of Homeland Security

## Executive Summary

The Department of Homeland Security was established in 2002 in direct response to the September 11 attacks, consolidating twenty-two federal agencies under a unified command structure with a clear mandate: protect the American homeland from terrorism, respond to natural disasters, secure the border, and safeguard critical infrastructure—all while upholding the constitutional rights that define the democratic republic being defended. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.) created this department not as a tool of political repression, but as a professional, mission-driven security institution. For the first two decades of its existence, DHS—however imperfectly—maintained that dual mission of security and rights protection.

Project 2025 shattered that balance. Under Secretary Kristi Noem and the directive architecture of the Heritage Foundation's blueprint, DHS was transformed from a homeland security institution into an instrument of mass migration enforcement, civil liberties suppression, and political weaponization. The department abandoned its counterterrorism mission in proportion to how thoroughly it embraced its new role as America's deportation apparatus. FEMA was hollowed out even as climate-driven disasters intensified. CISA—the nation's cybersecurity defense—was gutted by DOGE even as foreign adversaries escalated attacks on critical infrastructure. The Coast Guard saw its shore infrastructure budget targeted for a 90 percent cut. And ICE expanded its detention population to a record 66,000 people by December 2025, the highest level ever recorded, while detention deaths reached numbers not seen since 2004.

The Project 2029 agenda for DHS is both restorative and transformative. Restorative because the damage inflicted since January 2025 requires immediate reversal—the asylum system must be rebuilt, the Alien Enemies Act invocations must be renounced, the sensitive locations policy must be reinstated, and the thousands of people wrongly detained must receive due process. Transformative because the underlying structures that allowed DHS to be weaponized must be dismantled and replaced with durable civil liberties protections, meaningful congressional oversight, independent accountability mechanisms, and a humane immigration system grounded in law. Security and liberty are not competing values. An America that is genuinely safe is one that is genuinely free.

**The Stakes**: The stakes could not be higher. In fiscal year 2025, more than 23 people died in ICE custody—the deadliest year since 2004. Hundreds of people were deported to El Salvador's CECOT maximum-security prison without notice or hearing, in direct violation of federal court orders. The nation's cybersecurity agency lost nearly 40 percent of its workforce while adversaries probed critical infrastructure. FEMA lost approximately 2,000 employees while climate disasters escalated in severity and frequency. Every day that these conditions persist, Americans are less safe, constitutional rights are less secure, and the international standing of the United States as a nation committed to rule of law erodes further.

**Key Reforms**:
- Immediately reinstate the sensitive locations policy protecting churches, schools, and hospitals from ICE enforcement, and codify that protection in statute
- Restore the asylum system in full compliance with the Immigration and Nationality Act and the 1967 Refugee Protocol, including credible fear interviews and immigration court access
- End the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against immigration matters and pursue repeal of the Act for non-wartime applications
- Rebuild CISA to full staffing and restore its election security and threat hunting missions
- Restore FEMA funding, reverse workforce reductions, and reinstate the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program
- Close Alligator Alcatraz and all state-operated immigration detention facilities that operate outside federal oversight standards
- Establish an independent ICE Oversight Board with investigatory and disciplinary authority
- Mandate body cameras for all ICE and CBP enforcement operations and require public reporting of use-of-force incidents
- Codify DACA protections in statute and create a pathway to permanent residency for long-term undocumented residents
- Implement community-based alternatives to detention for all non-dangerous individuals

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. § 101); the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.); the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. § 5121 et seq.); the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 (6 U.S.C. § 651 et seq.); the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees; the Convention Against Torture (CAT), ratified by the United States in 1994; and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-603).

## Part I: Project 2025 DHS Damage and Destruction

### The Weaponization of Immigration Enforcement

**What Project 2025 Did:**

On January 20, 2025, the Trump administration rescinded the longstanding sensitive locations policy that had protected churches, schools, hospitals, courthouses, and other civil institutions from immigration enforcement operations. This policy, maintained across multiple administrations of both parties, recognized that certain spaces must remain accessible to all people regardless of immigration status—because communities cannot function if immigrants fear arrest while sending children to school, seeking medical care, or attending religious services. The rescission was immediate and comprehensive.

**Abandonment of Prosecutorial Discretion.** Project 2025 explicitly directs DHS to eliminate prosecutorial discretion, treating all undocumented people as equally prioritized enforcement targets regardless of their individual circumstances, family ties, community contributions, or the severity of any offense. The 2025 executive orders directed DHS to terminate prior memoranda establishing enforcement priorities and to treat the presence of any person without lawful status as a basis for removal without case-by-case evaluation. This directive conflated Dreamers brought to the United States as children, farm workers with decades of community ties, and individuals with serious criminal records into a single undifferentiated enforcement target.

**The Alien Enemies Act Invocations.** In March 2025, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798—a wartime statute enacted during the quasi-war with France—to declare that members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua constituted an invading force. On March 15, 2025, 238 Venezuelan nationals were deported to El Salvador's CECOT maximum-security prison under this invocation, without notice, without hearings, and in defiance of a federal court's temporary restraining order issued the same evening by Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Of those 238 individuals, 137 were removed under the Alien Enemies Act and 101 under ordinary immigration law. Judge Boasberg subsequently found that the deportations violated constitutional due process requirements. After a four-month ordeal that included documented abuse within CECOT, all 252 Venezuelan nationals were eventually returned to Venezuela in July 2025—but only after international pressure and court orders forced the administration's hand.

**Mass Detention at Unprecedented Scale.** The ICE detention population grew from approximately 40,000 people in January 2025 to 66,000 by December 2025—a 75 percent increase and the highest detention level ever recorded in American history. For the first time, thousands of immigrants arrested in the interior of the United States were held in hastily constructed tent camps, where access to legal counsel, medical care, and basic sanitation was severely compromised. The expansion of detention capacity was achieved not through congressional appropriation and oversight, but through state partnerships with facilities that operate outside federal standards, including the Alligator Alcatraz facility in Florida.

---

### Alligator Alcatraz and the Subcontracting of Inhumanity

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The administration partnered with Florida and other states to create detention facilities that deliberately operate outside federal oversight frameworks. "Alligator Alcatraz"—the Everglades Detention Facility opened in July 2025 with capacity to hold approximately 3,000 people—became the most prominent example of this approach. As the first state-owned and state-operated immigration detention facility in the United States, Alligator Alcatraz was specifically designed to evade the federal standards that govern ICE facilities.

**Documented Conditions.** Amnesty International's December 2025 report documented conditions at Alligator Alcatraz and the Krome Detention Center in Florida that the organization characterized as amounting to torture in some cases.

Detained individuals reported:
- Overflowing toilets with fecal matter seeping into sleeping areas
- More than thirty people confined per cage with only three toilets, often broken
- Lights maintained at full intensity twenty-four hours per day, preventing sleep
- Exposure to insects without protective measures in an Everglades environment
- Limited shower access—in some cases no access for multiple days
- Poor quality food and water
- No registration or intake tracking, making location unknown to families
- Use of a punitive device called "the box"—a two-foot-by-two-foot structure in which detainees were shackled at hands and feet and chained to the ground in open sun for hours without food or water The facility operated without the basic registration and tracking systems used in ICE facilities, with Amnesty International concluding that this absence of registration facilitated what amounted to enforced disappearances when families could not determine the whereabouts of detained relatives.

**ACLU Documentation at Other Facilities.** At Fort Bliss, individuals in ICE custody documented reports of violent assaults by officers, including sexual abuse, with some detainees reporting that officers crushed their testicles during beatings. These allegations, reported by the American Civil Liberties Union, represent the most severe end of a spectrum of abuse that extended across multiple expanded facilities where oversight was absent and accountability nonexistent.

**State Partnerships Expanding the Model.** The administration used the 287(g) program to partner not only with Florida on Alligator Alcatraz, but with Indiana on the "Speedway Slammer," Nebraska on "Cornhusker Clink," and Louisiana on "Louisiana Lockup"—facilities whose very names signal contempt for the dignity of those detained. None of these facilities were subject to independent inspection regimes or the National Detention Standards that govern ICE-operated facilities. The deliberate use of state partnerships to house detainees outside federal oversight standards represents a structural choice to evade accountability—a choice that Project 2025 contemplated and the administration implemented.

**Collapsed Oversight.** ICE detention facility inspections dropped by 36.25 percent in 2025 even as the detained population surged. The administration simultaneously gutted the internal watchdog functions within DHS that would normally flag violations: civil rights workers were laid off, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was reduced in staffing and authority, and new restrictions were placed on congressional inspections of detention facilities. NPR reported in October 2025 that laid-off civil rights workers warned that the oversight collapse would produce precisely the violations that were subsequently documented at facilities across the country.

**DACA Recipients Ensnared in Mass Enforcement.** Between January 1 and November 19, 2025, ICE arrested 261 DACA beneficiaries and deported 86 of them—individuals who, by definition, had passed rigorous background checks required for DACA renewal every two years. The arrests of DACA recipients represented the collapse of any principled enforcement framework: individuals who had lived in the United States since childhood, were lawfully present under federal policy, and had no serious criminal history were swept up in enforcement operations indistinguishable from the arrest of any undocumented person. DHS also urged DACA recipients to self-deport, while simultaneously refusing to process new initial DACA applications. The program's legal status remained uncertain pending federal court litigation, with the Fifth Circuit having held that DACA's protection from deportation was lawful but its work permit component potentially unlawful as applied in Texas.

### The Destruction of the Asylum System

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The Immigration and Nationality Act, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158, establishes that any person who arrives in the United States, regardless of immigration status or manner of entry, may apply for asylum. This statutory guarantee reflects the United States' commitment under the 1967 Refugee Protocol, which the United States ratified and which obligates this country to non-refoulement—the principle that persons may not be returned to countries where they face persecution. Project 2025 systematically dismantled the mechanisms through which asylum seekers could exercise these statutory rights.

**CBP One Elimination and Port of Entry Access.** The administration terminated the CBP One appointment system on January 20, 2025, immediately eliminating the primary lawful pathway through which asylum seekers scheduled presentations at ports of entry. By October 2025, CBP had not released a single migrant into the U.S. interior for six consecutive months. The January 2025 White House proclamation effectively suspended the asylum system at the border in its entirety.

**Metering and Physical Turnbacks.** CBP continued and expanded the practice of metering—physically limiting the number of individuals permitted to access the asylum process at ports of entry on any given day. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in a ruling that the administration defied, held that systematic turnbacks of asylum seekers at ports of entry violated federal law. The administration's response was to challenge the ruling and expand its practice of denying port-of-entry access.

**Safe Third Country Agreements and Remain in Mexico.** The administration reinstituted and expanded the Migrant Protection Protocols (Remain in Mexico) and pressured third countries to sign agreements restricting asylum seekers' ability to apply in the United States. These policies forced vulnerable individuals—including unaccompanied minors, survivors of domestic violence, and those fleeing gang violence—to remain in dangerous border regions while awaiting immigration proceedings. Human rights organizations documented continued violence against individuals returned to border cities in Mexico under Remain in Mexico, including kidnappings, assaults, and homicides by cartels who specifically targeted those known to be waiting for U.S. immigration proceedings.

**Family Separation Reinstated and Expanded.** The administration reinstituted the family separation policy as a deterrence tool. Families arriving at the border with children were separated at CBP processing facilities, with parents transferred to immigration detention and children transferred to HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement custody. The trauma of family separation—documented extensively during the first Trump administration, including findings of lasting psychological harm to children—was reinflicted on a new cohort of families. No systematic reunification mechanism was established in advance, recreating the chaotic and harmful conditions of the 2018 "zero tolerance" policy.

**Destruction of the Credible Fear Process.** The credible fear interview process, established by 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1), is the front-line mechanism through which individuals who arrive at or between ports of entry claim asylum. A credible fear finding—that the individual has a significant possibility of establishing eligibility for asylum—triggers the right to a full removal proceeding before an immigration judge. The administration implemented policies that dramatically curtailed the credible fear process: limiting interview access, reducing the number of asylum officers conducting interviews, and applying heightened standards inconsistent with the statutory "significant possibility" threshold established in INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421 (1987). As a result, thousands of individuals with valid asylum claims were returned without the hearing to which they were entitled by statute.

### The Gutting of FEMA and Climate Disaster Preparedness

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 explicitly calls for restructuring FEMA's mission and shifting disaster response responsibilities to states—a position that, if implemented, would effectively end federal disaster coordination as it has existed since the Robert T. Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. § 5121 et seq.) was enacted in 1988. The administration moved aggressively toward this goal in 2025, with devastating consequences.

**Workforce Dismemberment.** FEMA lost approximately 2,000 employees in 2025 due to layoffs and departures—including many senior staff with institutional expertise—through the administration's workforce reduction program. The administration's proposed fiscal year 2026 budget included additional cuts that would reduce FEMA's total workforce by 50 percent, including a 15 percent reduction in the permanent full-time workforce and a 41 percent reduction in the disaster full-time workforce. By January 2026, members of Congress from both parties were decrying reports of additional planned reductions.

**Disaster Aid Denial.** The administration denied and delayed decisions on numerous state requests for disaster aid. California's appeal for aid following the 2024 wildfires was denied. At least twelve state requests for aid were denied from the start of the Trump administration. In February 2026, FEMA announced it would release billions in disaster aid—but excluded several blue states from the distribution, making explicit what had been implicit: disaster aid was being administered as a political instrument rather than a humanitarian one.

**Program Termination.** In April 2025, the administration attempted to end the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which funded pre-disaster mitigation activities including making homes, schools, and community facilities more resilient to fires, floods, and other climate disasters. The administration also announced its intention to eliminate FEMA entirely, replacing it with a state-administered system—a proposal that, if implemented, would leave smaller and poorer states without meaningful disaster response capacity in an era of escalating climate events.

### The Dismantling of CISA and Cybersecurity Defense

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 (6 U.S.C. § 651 et seq.) established CISA as the nation's lead federal agency for protecting critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. CISA's mission encompasses protecting electrical grids, water systems, financial networks, healthcare systems, and election infrastructure from domestic and foreign threats. Project 2025 identified CISA's election security work and its disinformation research as impermissible political activities—and used DOGE to gut the agency.

**Workforce Destruction.** DOGE's intervention in CISA resulted in the termination and resignation of approximately 1,300 positions—nearly 40 percent of CISA's workforce. The administration's fiscal year 2026 budget proposed reducing CISA from 3,732 funded positions to 2,649 positions, cutting the agency's budget by nearly $500 million from its enacted level.

Proposed reductions by division:
- Cybersecurity division: from 1,267 positions to 1,063
- Infrastructure security division: from 343 positions to 325
- Mission support division: from 788 positions to 570
- Integrated operations division: from 827 positions to 500
- Emergency communications division: from 104 positions to 80

CISA's top recruits—including those brought in through competitive fellowship programs to modernize federal cybersecurity capabilities—were among those terminated. These individuals, recruited at significant public expense from top universities and the private sector, took their expertise with them when they left. CBS News reported that the loss of these recruits represented a generational talent drain that will take years to reverse.

**Threat Hunting Eliminated.** Budget documents revealed that CISA intended to end all threat hunting contracts with the private sector. Threat hunting—proactively searching for adversary intrusions in critical systems before they cause damage—is among the most cost-effective cybersecurity investments the federal government makes. Its elimination leaves critical infrastructure operators without early warning of sophisticated intrusions from nation-state adversaries including Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.

**Election Security Mission Abandoned.** CISA's election security coordination function, which provided threat briefings and technical assistance to state election officials across the country, was effectively defunded. This occurred at precisely the moment when foreign adversaries had demonstrated, through the 2016 and 2020 election cycles, the depth of their interest in compromising American electoral infrastructure.

**Budget Consequences.** CISA's fiscal year 2026 funding level was set at $2.6 billion—approximately $300 million less than its then-current annual budget, and approximately $500 million less than what the agency needed to fulfill its statutory missions. These cuts were not driven by any assessment that CISA's workload had declined—to the contrary, the cyber threat environment intensified throughout 2025 as adversaries recognized that the agency's defensive capacity had been degraded.

---

### Coast Guard and Maritime Security Underfunding

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Secretary Noem proposed cutting the Coast Guard's shore infrastructure budget by 90 percent—a reduction that lawmakers from both parties described as pushing the service's housing, facilities, and piers into potentially irreversible disrepair. The Coast Guard, which serves simultaneously as a military service under Title 10 and a law enforcement and humanitarian agency under Title 14, had already been chronically underfunded relative to its mission. The proposed reductions threatened the operational capacity of the service's ports, airfields, and vessel maintenance facilities. Members of Congress from coastal states, including Republican members whose constituents rely on Coast Guard search and rescue operations and port security, publicly condemned the proposed cuts.

The administration's simultaneous expansion of immigration enforcement missions for the Coast Guard—including maritime interdiction operations in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific—increased operational demands on an agency being stripped of the facilities required to sustain those operations. This contradiction—expanding the Coast Guard's enforcement mission while cutting the infrastructure that supports that mission—reflected the broader dysfunction of an administration that treated DHS as an immigration enforcement apparatus while neglecting the full range of missions the department is responsible for.

**DOGE's Role Across DHS.** The Department of Government Efficiency conducted sweeping reductions across DHS components beyond CISA. The Secret Service, responsible for protective missions covering the President, Vice President, senior executive branch officials, and major candidates for office, was targeted for potential significant staff reductions. This targeting occurred while the protective threat environment remained at elevated levels. DOGE's intervention in DHS was not guided by mission analysis or security assessment—it was guided by budget reduction targets applied without regard to the operational consequences for national security.

---

### The Surveillance and Civil Liberties Dimension

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Beyond the immigration enforcement abuses, the administration used DHS components to expand domestic surveillance capabilities in ways that threatened First Amendment-protected activities and Fourth Amendment rights.

**Fusion Center Expansion and Political Targeting.** The nation's network of state and local fusion centers—information-sharing bodies originally designed to facilitate counterterrorism coordination—were expanded and redirected toward monitoring protest activity, immigration advocacy organizations, and groups critical of the administration's policies. Civil liberties organizations documented instances in which fusion centers shared information about lawful protest activities with ICE field offices, facilitating enforcement actions that appeared designed to deter participation in First Amendment-protected activities.

**Electronic Device Searches at the Border.** The administration expanded CBP's practice of conducting forensic searches of electronic devices at the border without individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. These searches—which can reveal the full contents of a smartphone or laptop, including confidential communications, legal documents, medical records, and journalistic source information—were conducted on U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents as well as foreign nationals. The Ninth Circuit's ruling in United States v. Cano, 934 F.3d 1002 (9th Cir. 2019) required reasonable suspicion for forensic device searches, but the administration directed CBP to apply a broader standard that the courts had not sanctioned.

**No-Fly List Expansion.** The Terrorist Screening Center's No-Fly List, maintained under DHS authority and administered in part through TSA, was expanded to include individuals based on criteria that civil liberties advocates argued were overbroad and not subject to meaningful review. U.S. citizens whose names appeared on the list received no individualized notice of the factual basis for their designation, and the redress process through the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program provided no meaningful opportunity to contest the underlying designation with access to the evidence used to make it.

---

### The Human Cost

The human cost of these policies is measurable and severe. At least 23 people died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the deadliest year for ICE detainees since 2004—more deaths than occurred during the entire COVID-19 pandemic period in prior years. The deaths resulted from documented causes including medical neglect, preventable conditions worsened by overcrowding, and mental health crises left untreated in facilities without adequate psychiatric staff.

Hundreds of thousands of families were separated when individuals without criminal histories were detained and removed after decades of life in American communities. An estimated 1.9 million people self-deported under the pressure of enforcement operations, many of them with deep ties to the United States—including DACA recipients and long-term permanent residents. Children were left without parents. Businesses lost workers. Communities lost members.

In disaster-prone states, FEMA's staffing reductions and program terminations meant slower response times, reduced pre-disaster mitigation funding, and diminished capacity to assist low-income and vulnerable populations in recovery. The administration's politicization of disaster aid determinations meant that whether a community received federal assistance became, in part, a function of whether that community's state had voted for the incumbent president.

And in cyberspace, the gutting of CISA left the nation measurably more vulnerable to foreign attack at a moment of heightened geopolitical tension.

The political targeting of civil society was equally damaging. Churches that sheltered undocumented parishioners faced pressure and surveillance. Sanctuary cities saw federal funding threatened for declining to participate in immigration enforcement. Immigrant advocacy organizations reported increased surveillance and intimidation. The cumulative effect was a chilling of First Amendment activity, civic participation, and public health-seeking behavior among immigrant communities—harms that extend well beyond the individuals directly subjected to enforcement action. When immigrants fear reporting crimes to police, attending public schools, or seeking medical treatment, entire communities are made less safe.

---

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

DHS operates at the intersection of multiple constitutional authorities. Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power to "establish a uniform rule of naturalization"—making immigration fundamentally a legislative function in which the executive branch acts as the implementing agent within parameters set by statute. The Supreme Court affirmed in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), that constitutional protections apply to all persons within the United States, including those with no lawful immigration status. In Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667 (2018), the Court upheld broad presidential authority over entry but noted that this authority must be exercised within statutory bounds.

The Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures applies at the border, with some modifications recognized by the courts, but the Supreme Court has never held that immigration enforcement authorities may conduct searches or seizures in violation of due process. The Fifth Amendment's due process clause applies to all persons within U.S. jurisdiction. The Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment extends to conditions of civil detention. The Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection principles prohibit discriminatory enforcement of immigration law on the basis of race, national origin, or religion.

The First Amendment's protections for speech, assembly, and religion establish constitutional constraints on the conduct of immigration enforcement in or near houses of worship, schools, and other expressive spaces—constraints that the rescission of the sensitive locations policy ignored.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.)**: Establishes DHS, defines its component agencies and their missions, and creates the statutory framework for the Secretary of Homeland Security's authority. Section 101 defines the department's primary mission as preventing terrorist attacks, reducing vulnerability to terrorism, and minimizing the damage from attacks or natural disasters.

**Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.)**: The comprehensive statutory framework for immigration law. Section 1158 (8 U.S.C. § 1158) establishes the right to apply for asylum. Section 1225 governs inspection of arriving aliens. Section 1231 governs removal. Section 1229a establishes the right to removal proceedings before an immigration judge. Section 1326 establishes criminal penalties for unlawful reentry.

**Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. § 5121 et seq.)**: Establishes the framework for federal disaster declarations and FEMA's authority to coordinate disaster response. Section 5170 governs major disaster declarations. Section 5195 establishes the Emergency Management Assistance Compact.

**Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 (6 U.S.C. § 651 et seq.)**: Establishes CISA's authority to coordinate cybersecurity across federal agencies and critical infrastructure sectors, provide technical assistance to state and local governments, and lead the nation's response to cyber incidents.

**Convention Against Torture (CAT)**: Ratified by the United States in 1994, codified at 8 C.F.R. § 208.16-.18. Prohibits removal of any person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing they would be subjected to torture. The deportations to CECOT violated both the letter and the spirit of CAT obligations.

### Due Process in Immigration Proceedings

The Supreme Court's decision in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), established the balancing test courts apply to procedural due process claims. Applied to immigration, the private interest in avoiding erroneous removal—including the risk of persecution or death—weighs heavily. The government's interest in efficient immigration enforcement, while substantial, does not override the constitutional requirement of meaningful notice and opportunity to be heard before removal.

The invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 does not eliminate due process requirements. As Chief Judge Boasberg ruled, even persons properly designated as alien enemies retain the right to "meaningful opportunity" to contest that designation before removal. The administration's conduct—deporting individuals while a federal court's temporary restraining order was in effect—constituted contempt of the judicial branch and a direct assault on the rule of law. The Supreme Court's decision in Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723 (2008), established that the Constitution's habeas corpus guarantee extends to individuals held by the U.S. government regardless of their citizenship status or the location of detention, a principle directly applicable to individuals held at CECOT pursuant to U.S. government agreement and funding.

### Congressional Authority and the Limits of Executive Power

The plenary power doctrine, which historically gave Congress and the executive branch broad authority over immigration with limited judicial review, does not eliminate constitutional protections for individuals subject to removal proceedings. The Supreme Court in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) held that habeas corpus review of legal questions in immigration proceedings cannot be stripped by Congress absent a clear statement to that effect. The Court in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001) held that indefinite detention of individuals whose removal cannot be effectuated raises serious due process concerns.

The administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act for immigration purposes raised fundamental questions about the limits of executive authority. The AEA, 50 U.S.C. § 21, authorizes the President to apprehend and remove citizens of a hostile nation during a declared war or invasion. Its application to Venezuelan nationals who had entered the United States years earlier, absent a congressional declaration of war or a factual finding of invasion meeting the legal standard, stretched the statute beyond any plausible textualist reading and was correctly identified by multiple federal judges as unlawful.

### International Human Rights Obligations

The United States ratified the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, binding this country to the 1951 Refugee Convention's core protections including non-refoulement—the obligation not to return a person to a country where they face persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Non-refoulement is recognized as a principle of customary international law binding on all states regardless of treaty ratification status.

The Convention Against Torture, ratified by the United States in 1994 and implemented through 8 C.F.R. § 208.16-.18, prohibits return of any person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing they would be subjected to torture. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the person is eligible for asylum. The deportation of individuals to El Salvador's CECOT facility—where Amnesty International subsequently documented torture—violated CAT obligations. The United States cannot avoid international legal responsibility by routing deportees through a contractual arrangement with a third country that then subjects them to torture.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), ratified by the United States in 1992, prohibits arbitrary detention, requires humane treatment of all detained persons, and guarantees the right to legal counsel. The conditions documented at Alligator Alcatraz and other expanded detention facilities violated the United States' ICCPR obligations.

## Part III: Comprehensive DHS Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: Restoring Humane and Lawful Immigration Enforcement

#### Reinstate Sensitive Locations Protections

On Day One, the incoming administration will issue an executive order reinstating the sensitive locations policy in its full prior scope, protecting churches, schools, hospitals, courthouses, and other civil institutions from immigration enforcement operations. Within the first 100 days, the administration will work with Congress to codify these protections in the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act (detailed in the Legislative Requirements section), ensuring that no future administration can eliminate them by executive fiat.

The policy will extend beyond the prior scope: enforcement near social service agencies, food banks, domestic violence shelters, and homeless services facilities will be explicitly prohibited without a judicial warrant supported by probable cause.

#### Reinstate and Strengthen Prosecutorial Discretion

The administration will issue a new ICE enforcement priorities directive that concentrates enforcement resources on individuals who pose genuine public safety threats—those with serious criminal convictions, documented gang affiliations confirmed through due process, and terrorism-related activities. Individuals who have lived peacefully in the United States for five or more years, DACA recipients, parents of U.S. citizen children, and individuals with pending immigration applications will be placed in a protected class not subject to removal absent extraordinary circumstances.

The administration will reinstate the Morton Memos (ICE Memorandum, June 17, 2011) framework for prosecutorial discretion and expand it through new guidance that requires supervisory approval for any enforcement action against individuals who fall within protected categories. The new directive will require ICE field offices to provide quarterly reports to DHS leadership disaggregated by enforcement priority category, ensuring that the directive's implementation is verifiable and that resources are not diverted from the highest-priority enforcement targets to pursue families and long-term residents who pose no public safety concern.

This approach is not only more humane—it is more effective. ICE's budget, personnel, and operational bandwidth are finite. Every agent hour spent tracking and detaining a DACA recipient or a farmworker without a criminal history is an agent hour not spent investigating human trafficking networks, drug smuggling organizations, or individuals with genuine violent criminal histories. Prosecutorial discretion is not a soft liberal preference; it is the basic tool of every effective law enforcement agency operating in a world of limited resources and unlimited potential targets.

#### Eliminate Alien Enemies Act Misapplication

The administration will immediately terminate all active Alien Enemies Act designations applied to immigration matters, review and vacate all removal orders issued pursuant to the 2025 AEA invocations, and work with Congress to amend the AEA to prohibit its application to civil immigration proceedings. The United States will cooperate fully with any judicial process for the return of individuals wrongly deported to third-country prisons, and will pursue accountability through the Inspector General for any official who violated court orders in connection with the CECOT deportations.

---

### Reform II: Rebuilding the Asylum System

#### Restore Statutory Asylum Access

The administration will immediately rescind the January 2025 proclamation suspending the asylum system at the border and restore full access to asylum processing at all ports of entry. The CBP One appointment system, or a successor application, will be reactivated with expanded capacity. Within 90 days, CBP and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will jointly establish an emergency processing protocol to address the backlog of asylum claims that accumulated during the suspension.

#### Rebuild Immigration Court Capacity

The United States immigration court system had a backlog of approximately 3.5 million pending cases as of January 2025. The administration will propose in the Asylum System Restoration and Immigration Judge Expansion Act a funding authorization for 500 additional immigration judges—bringing the total bench to approximately 1,000—along with proportional increases in support staff, interpreters, and legal aid funding. Immigration judges will be hired through a competitive process that prioritizes expertise in immigration law and international human rights standards rather than ideological alignment.

#### Legal Representation Guarantee

Due process requires adequate opportunity to present one's case. The administration will establish a federal legal representation fund, administered through the Legal Services Corporation and contracted nonprofit immigration legal services organizations, to ensure that no person faces removal proceedings without access to competent legal counsel. The cost of this program—approximately $200 million annually—is a fraction of the cost of the litigation, incarceration, and enforcement operations generated by proceedings in which unrepresented individuals make errors that lead to wrongful removals and subsequent legal challenges.

The practical case for universal legal representation in immigration proceedings is unambiguous: represented individuals are significantly more likely to appear for all hearings, making them more appropriate candidates for release on supervision rather than detention. Studies by the Vera Institute of Justice and the American Immigration Council have found that represented immigrants are 10.5 times more likely to obtain immigration relief than unrepresented individuals facing the same underlying facts, suggesting that a substantial portion of removals occurring without representation involve individuals who would have qualified for protection if they had counsel. Legal representation does not merely serve the individual—it serves the accuracy and efficiency of the immigration court system as a whole.

#### Non-Refoulement and Third Country Agreements

The administration will withdraw from or renegotiate all Asylum Cooperative Agreements signed after January 2021 that do not provide genuine protection equivalent to U.S. asylum standards. The administration will not return any individual to a country where there is credible evidence of persecution, torture, or death, consistent with obligations under the 1967 Refugee Protocol and the Convention Against Torture.

---

### Reform III: ICE Reform and Accountability

#### Establish an Independent ICE Oversight Board

The administration will, through executive order and congressional legislation, establish an Independent ICE Oversight Board with the authority to investigate complaints against ICE agents, review enforcement operations for constitutional compliance, access detention facilities without prior notice, compel production of records, and refer cases of misconduct for criminal prosecution or civil penalties. Board members will be appointed through a bipartisan confirmation process and will include immigration law experts, civil rights attorneys, community advocates, and retired law enforcement professionals.

This model draws on the successful experience of civilian oversight boards in major metropolitan police departments and fills the institutional gap left by the ineffective complaint processing within ICE's existing internal affairs function.

#### Mandatory Body Cameras and Transparency

All ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents will be required to wear functioning body cameras during all enforcement actions, including arrests, searches of premises, and detainee transports, pursuant to a new DHS body camera policy issued by executive order. Video footage will be retained for a minimum of five years and will be available to the subjects of enforcement actions, their attorneys, congressional oversight committees, and—upon completion of any investigation—the public.

Monthly use-of-force reports will be published on the DHS website, disaggregated by component agency, geographic area, type of force used, and demographic characteristics of the individuals involved.

#### End Detention Quotas and Contract Incentives

The administration will terminate all contracts and intergovernmental service agreements that include per-diem payments structured to incentivize detention of large numbers of individuals regardless of risk assessment. ICE detention decisions will be governed by a risk-based framework that employs community-based alternatives to detention for all individuals who do not present documented flight risks or public safety concerns. The administration will propose elimination of the statutory bed mandate that has required ICE to maintain a minimum number of detention beds, a mandate that creates perverse incentives for detention over alternatives.

#### Community-Based Alternatives to Detention

The administration will fund and expand the Family Case Management Program and analogous case management alternatives, which have demonstrated appearance rates of 99 percent in immigration proceedings at a fraction of the cost of detention. Case management participants who appear for all proceedings, comply with all conditions of supervision, and present no public safety concerns will be eligible for deferred action pending final adjudication of their immigration cases.

---

### Reform IV: Closing Inhumane Detention Facilities and Establishing National Standards

#### Close Alligator Alcatraz and Non-Compliant State Facilities

Within sixty days of taking office, the administration will terminate the intergovernmental service agreement with Florida for the Everglades Detention Facility (Alligator Alcatraz) and all analogous state-operated facilities that do not meet the ICE National Detention Standards. Individuals currently held in these facilities will be transferred to facilities meeting federal standards or released on community supervision pending their immigration proceedings.

The administration will simultaneously initiate a criminal referral to the Department of Justice for investigation of conditions documented by Amnesty International at Alligator Alcatraz, including potential violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2340 (torture), 18 U.S.C. § 242 (deprivation of rights under color of law), and the Convention Against Torture implementing legislation.

#### National Detention Standards with Enforcement

The administration will promulgate new National Detention Standards as binding regulations through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process required by the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 553), replacing the current system in which standards are applied through contract terms that are inconsistently enforced. These standards will require: adequate medical staffing ratios; maximum occupancy limits; access to counsel; access to legal materials; adequate food, water, and sanitation; prohibition on punitive solitary confinement; and access to religious services.

Compliance will be verified through unannounced inspections by the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, with inspection reports published on the DHS website within thirty days of each inspection. Facilities with repeated or serious violations will face contract termination.

---

### Reform V: Rebuilding FEMA and Climate Resilience

#### Restore FEMA Workforce and Mission

The administration will immediately halt and reverse all DOGE-directed FEMA staffing reductions, reinstate employees terminated through the workforce reduction program where possible, and initiate competitive hiring to fill vacancies created by departures. The FEMA workforce of approximately 23,000—including the disaster full-time workforce that provides surge capacity for major disasters—will be restored to pre-2025 levels as a first priority.

The administration will rescind the executive order directing disaster preparedness responsibility to shift to states and reaffirm the federal government's primary coordinating role in major disaster response under the Stafford Act. States retain concurrent authority and responsibility, but the federal backstop—essential for smaller and poorer states without the resources to independently respond to major disasters—will be restored and strengthened.

#### Reinstate and Expand Disaster Mitigation Programs

The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program will be reinstated and funded at twice its pre-2025 appropriation level, reflecting the documented cost-effectiveness of pre-disaster mitigation investment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Hazard Mapping Program will be fully funded and updated to incorporate current climate projections. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (42 U.S.C. § 5170c) will be funded at the statutory maximum.

The administration will work with Congress to pass the Climate Resilience and Disaster Preparedness Act, establishing a permanent pre-disaster mitigation fund capitalized at $10 billion over five years, prioritizing investments in communities facing the highest risk from climate-driven disasters.

#### Depoliticize Disaster Aid

The administration will issue an executive order requiring that all decisions on presidential disaster declarations and major disaster designations be made on the basis of established meteorological, geological, and public health criteria, without regard to the political characteristics of the affected state or community. Any employee who participates in or documents political considerations being applied to disaster aid decisions will be required to report that conduct to the DHS Inspector General and will be protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. § 2302).

---

### Reform VI: Rebuilding CISA and Cybersecurity Defense

#### Restore CISA Staffing and Authority

The administration will reverse all DOGE-directed CISA staffing reductions, reinstate terminated employees where possible, and initiate an emergency hiring program to fill critical vacancies in threat hunting, vulnerability management, and election security functions. The administration will propose in the Cybersecurity Workforce and Infrastructure Defense Act a multi-year authorization to restore CISA funding to at least $3.1 billion annually—approximately the agency's pre-2025 enacted budget—and to fund an additional 500 positions focused on emerging threats in artificial intelligence, quantum computing vulnerabilities, and space systems.

#### Restore Election Security Mission

CISA's election security function—which provided technical assistance and threat briefings to election officials in all fifty states and the District of Columbia—will be fully restored and expanded. The administration will establish a permanent Election Security Coordination Center within CISA, co-located with representatives from the Election Assistance Commission, the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to provide unified threat assessment and response during election cycles.

#### Expand Critical Infrastructure Protection

CISA will reinstate all suspended threat hunting contracts with the private sector and expand the Protective Security Advisor program to cover all 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified under Presidential Policy Directive 21. The administration will publish an updated National Cyber Incident Response Plan within 180 days of taking office and conduct a joint public-private exercise to test federal response capacity.

#### Establish a National AI and Emerging Technology Cybersecurity Center

The proliferation of artificial intelligence systems in critical infrastructure, financial markets, healthcare delivery, and government operations has created new categories of cyber vulnerability that CISA's existing authorities and capabilities were not designed to address. The administration will work with Congress to establish within CISA a National AI and Emerging Technology Cybersecurity Center, charged with assessing risks from AI-enabled attacks, developing standards for AI system security in critical infrastructure contexts, and coordinating with sector-specific agencies on AI security requirements. The Center will also address quantum computing vulnerabilities, which threaten to render current encryption standards obsolete as quantum hardware matures.

---

### Reform X: Structural Reforms to DHS Oversight and Accountability

#### Strengthen the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties

The DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), established by 6 U.S.C. § 345, was designed to review DHS programs for compliance with civil rights and civil liberties requirements and to provide oversight of DHS enforcement activities. Under the Trump administration, CRCL's authority was curtailed, its staffing reduced, and its reports suppressed. The administration will restore CRCL to full staffing, elevate its Director to a position requiring Senate confirmation, grant it enforcement authority rather than merely advisory authority, and require it to publish quarterly public reports on civil rights and civil liberties conditions across all DHS components.

CRCL will be empowered to conduct unannounced visits to all DHS detention and processing facilities, to review enforcement operation plans before implementation for civil liberties compliance, and to refer substantiated civil rights violations directly to the Department of Justice without requiring approval from DHS leadership. This structural independence is essential: an oversight office that depends on the Secretary for authority to act cannot credibly oversee the Secretary's operations.

#### Strengthen the DHS Inspector General

The DHS Inspector General, operating under the Inspector General Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-452), is the primary accountability mechanism for detecting fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement within DHS operations. The Trump administration systematically undermined IG independence across the federal government, including at DHS. The administration will restore full IG independence, ensure adequate funding for IG operations across all DHS components, and work with Congress to pass legislation prohibiting retaliation against IG offices for conducting authorized investigations.

The IG will be granted statutory authority to access all DHS facilities, including state-operated facilities holding federal detainees under intergovernmental service agreements, without prior notification. IG reports will be transmitted simultaneously to DHS leadership and to the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees, ensuring that Congress receives unfiltered information about conditions within DHS operations.

#### Restore Congressional Oversight

The administration will affirmatively cooperate with congressional oversight of DHS operations, ending the practice of document production refusals, witness instruction not to answer questions, and classification of information to prevent congressional review that characterized the 2025-2029 period. The Secretary of Homeland Security will testify before the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees on a schedule of no less than four times per year. Component agency heads will testify on a semi-annual schedule. All subpoenas and document requests from oversight committees will be fulfilled within the timeframes specified by congressional rules absent a specific, documented legal privilege claimed in writing.

The administration will work with Congress to pass the DHS Inspector General Independence and Congressional Oversight Act, which establishes statutory protections for IG access and testimony and provides criminal penalties for interference with authorized congressional oversight activities.

---

### Reform VII: CBP Reform and Border Management

#### Accountability and Independent Oversight

The administration will establish an independent Office of Border Accountability within the DHS Office of Inspector General, with specific authority to investigate CBP use-of-force incidents, review turnback operations for compliance with the INA, audit medical care provided at border facilities, and investigate allegations of abuse or mistreatment. This office will have the authority to compel testimony and documents from CBP employees without prior notification to CBP leadership.

All CBP Border Patrol agents operating in enforcement roles will be required to wear body cameras, and all use-of-force incidents will be reviewed by a Use of Force Review Board that includes external members from civil rights organizations and legal academia.

#### Humanitarian Capacity at the Border

The administration will fund and staff adequate humanitarian reception facilities at all major ports of entry, including medical personnel, licensed social workers, interpreters covering all languages spoken by border arrivals, and legal aid providers. No individual, including those arriving without documentation, will be held in CBP processing facilities for more than 72 hours without transfer to a humane long-term processing facility or release on supervision.

Unaccompanied minors will be transferred to HHS custody within 24 hours of apprehension, consistent with the requirements of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (22 U.S.C. § 7105), and will never be held in adult detention facilities.

---

### Reform VIII: Codify DACA and Create Pathways to Citizenship

#### DACA Statutory Codification

The administration will immediately reinstate DACA protections by executive action for current and former recipients whose status was terminated during the Trump administration, and will work with Congress to pass the American Promise Act—legislation that codifies DACA protections, creates a pathway to permanent resident status for DACA recipients, and establishes a ten-year pathway to citizenship for those who meet specific criteria including continuous residence, no serious criminal history, and demonstrated community ties.

Approximately 650,000 current DACA recipients and an estimated additional 1.1 million individuals who were eligible for DACA but unable to apply due to program restrictions will be eligible for protection under this legislation.

#### Earned Pathways for Long-Term Residents

The administration will propose comprehensive immigration legislation that creates earned pathways to permanent residency for individuals who have resided continuously in the United States for ten or more years, have no serious criminal convictions, and can demonstrate payment of back taxes and English language proficiency or active participation in English language learning. This is not amnesty—it is recognition of the economic and social reality that millions of people have built their lives, families, and communities in the United States over decades, and that mass deportation of this population would inflict devastating human harm while producing no proportionate security benefit.

---

### Reform IX: TSA Reform and Civil Liberties at Transportation Checkpoints

#### No-Fly List Due Process

The administration will implement recommendations from the Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to establish a meaningful review process for individuals placed on the No-Fly List and the Terrorist Screening Dataset. Any U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident denied a privilege on the basis of a terrorist watchlist designation will have the right to receive notice of the factual basis for that designation (to the extent consistent with classified information protection requirements), to present evidence contesting the designation, and to have that evidence reviewed by a neutral arbiter outside the intelligence agencies that made the original designation.

#### Border Device Searches

The administration will issue a policy directive requiring that searches of electronic devices at the border be conducted only upon reasonable suspicion of criminal activity related to the device's content, consistent with the Fourth Amendment framework. The administration will support litigation to establish that forensic searches of electronic devices at the border require warrant-level judicial authorization.

The policy will specifically protect:
- Attorney-client privileged communications
- Journalist source materials and unpublished work product
- Medical and mental health records
- Content protected by domestic violence confidentiality statutes
- Materials of religious organizations

---

### Reform XI: Restoring DHS Science, Research, and Data Integrity

#### Restore Science and Data Integrity

Project 2025 directed DHS to eliminate or suppress data collection and research that generated evidence inconvenient to the administration's enforcement agenda. DHS's own Office of Immigration Statistics saw its data publication schedule disrupted, making it impossible for Congress, civil society, and the public to evaluate the effectiveness or constitutionality of enforcement operations in real time. The administration will:

- Restore the Office of Immigration Statistics to full operational status with an annual publication schedule for all standard statistical reports
- Require that ICE publish complete data on enforcement actions, detentions, removals, and detention conditions on a monthly basis
- Require that CBP publish complete data on port of entry encounters, turnbacks, and use-of-force incidents on a monthly basis
- Prohibit any DHS official from suppressing or modifying data collection in order to avoid generating evidence that reflects negatively on administration operations
- Restore CISA's publication of its annual cyber threat landscape assessments
- Restore FEMA's publication of its annual national preparedness report, which was suppressed during the Trump administration
- Require that the DHS Science and Technology Directorate publish an annual research agenda subject to peer review and public comment

#### Restore the Scientific Advisory Infrastructure

DHS relies on scientific advisory committees for expert input on a range of technical decisions, from radiation detection technologies to pandemic preparedness to cybersecurity standards. The Trump administration removed qualified scientists from advisory roles and replaced them in some cases with industry representatives without relevant scientific expertise. The administration will:

- Restore all DHS Federal Advisory Committees to the composition and advisory processes required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2)
- Require that advisory committee members be selected on the basis of documented expertise relevant to the committee's mission
- Prohibit selection of advisory committee members based on political affiliation or alignment with administration policy positions
- Require that advisory committee recommendations be published and formally addressed in any DHS rulemaking to which they are relevant
- Restore the DHS Biodefense Advisory Committee, the Homeland Security Science and Technology Advisory Committee, and all other committees suspended or eliminated between January 2025 and the start of the new administration

---

### Reform XII: International Cooperation and Migration Management

#### Comprehensive Migration Diplomacy

The root causes of irregular migration from Central America, the Caribbean, and other regions are not addressable through domestic immigration enforcement alone. People do not leave their homes, families, and communities unless conditions at home make it impossible to remain. The administration will pursue a comprehensive migration diplomacy strategy that:

- Restores funding for the Root Causes of Migration programs established in Central America under the Biden administration, which addressed poverty, violence, corruption, and lack of economic opportunity in the Northern Triangle countries (Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador)
- Negotiates genuine burden-sharing agreements with Mexico, Canada, and other hemispheric partners for orderly processing of asylum seekers through the hemisphere, structured around UNHCR standards rather than deterrence
- Works with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to establish regional processing centers in safe third countries with genuine protection capacity—not facilities like CECOT, which subjects deportees to conditions Amnesty International has documented as torture
- Rebuilds the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to its pre-2017 capacity of approximately 125,000 refugees per year, as a lawful and orderly alternative to irregular migration
- Provides targeted economic development assistance to communities in origin countries that are major sources of outmigration, in coordination with the Millennium Challenge Corporation and USAID
- Engages the Organization of American States and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on hemispheric migration management standards and accountability for member states that violate the rights of migrants in transit
- Pursues bilateral security cooperation with Central American governments conditional on measurable progress on rule of law, reduction of gang violence, and protection of civil society—the conditions that drive displacement

#### Restore the Refugee Admissions Program

The United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) was virtually eliminated under the Trump administration, with refugee admissions dropping from 125,000 under the Biden administration's authorized ceiling to a fraction of that number. Refugees are among the most thoroughly vetted individuals who enter the United States, undergoing multi-year screening processes by USCIS, the State Department, and intelligence agencies. The administration will:

- Restore the refugee admissions ceiling to 125,000 for the first fiscal year and increase it to 200,000 by Year 3
- Provide additional emergency refugee designation for specific high-need populations facing acute persecution, including LGBTQ+ refugees from countries with criminalization laws, religious minorities, and targeted political dissidents
- Restore USRAP processing infrastructure—including the Reception and Placement program and resettlement agency network—that was atrophied during the Trump administration
- Work with Congress to amend the Refugee Act of 1980 (8 U.S.C. § 1521 et seq.) to establish a floor of no fewer than 50,000 refugee admissions per year that the executive branch may not reduce without specific congressional authorization

## Section VI: The Path Forward — Security, Dignity, and Democracy

The Department of Homeland Security is at its most effective when its missions are clearly defined, its authorities are appropriately constrained, its personnel are professional and well-supported, and the communities it serves trust it to exercise power responsibly. None of those conditions existed at the end of the Trump administration's second term. Rebuilding them will take sustained effort, significant investment, and the political will to resist the impulse to define security exclusively in terms of exclusion and enforcement.

The genuine threats facing the American homeland in 2029 and beyond are not primarily threats from undocumented immigrants. They are threats from sophisticated nation-state adversaries conducting cyber operations against critical infrastructure. They are threats from domestic violent extremism, which the FBI consistently identifies as the most significant terrorism threat within the United States. They are threats from climate-driven disasters—hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and droughts—that are growing in frequency and severity. They are threats from pandemic disease, transnational criminal organizations, and technological disruptions to financial and communications systems.

An immigration enforcement apparatus consuming the bulk of DHS's operational attention and budget is not optimized to meet those threats. A CISA gutted of its workforce cannot protect the electrical grid or secure an election. A FEMA stripped of personnel and programs cannot coordinate an effective response to a major hurricane or earthquake. A Coast Guard deprived of facility maintenance cannot conduct sustained search and rescue or maritime law enforcement operations.

The reforms in this chapter are not concessions to the left at the expense of security. They are the preconditions for effective security. When immigrant communities trust law enforcement, they report crimes—including crimes by criminal enterprises that prey on those communities. When asylum seekers have access to orderly legal processes, irregular border crossings decline because people have a lawful avenue. When CISA is fully staffed, adversaries face meaningful resistance. When FEMA is adequately funded, communities recover faster and the economic costs of disasters are reduced.

The choice is not between security and civil liberties. The choice is between a security apparatus that respects rights and is thereby effective, legitimate, and sustainable—and one that violates rights, destroys trust, and ultimately undermines both the security and the democratic character of the nation it claims to protect.

There is also a profound moral dimension to this agenda. The United States is a nation built by immigrants, sustained by immigrants, and defined in its founding documents by the proposition that all people—not all citizens, but all people—are endowed with inalienable rights. When this government chains a human being to the ground in open sun for hours as punishment, or deports a person to a foreign prison without a hearing while flouting a federal court order, it does not merely violate statute and international obligation. It violates the foundational principle of American democracy. It makes the United States a country that does not believe its own creed.

Rebuilding DHS into an institution worthy of that creed is not optional, not aspirational, and not merely politically convenient. It is a moral requirement. The reforms in this chapter are the mechanism through which that requirement is fulfilled—not through sentiment, but through law, policy, accountability, and the determined exercise of democratic authority.

Project 2029's DHS agenda chooses humane, effective, lawful homeland security over political theater, without apology and without hesitation. The American people deserve both security and liberty. This chapter delivers both.
