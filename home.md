## Two Agendas. One Mission.

<div class="callout">

**Restorative Agenda — Chapters 1-29**

Reverse Project 2025 damage across every federal agency. Rebuild democratic institutions. Establish legal accountability for those who subverted democracy. Implement structural safeguards to prevent recurrence.

</div>

<div class="callout tip">

**Transformative Agenda — Chapter 30 + Integrated Throughout**

Go beyond restoration to build the democracy we have never had. Overturn Citizens United. Abolish the Electoral College. Universal basic services. Billionaire minimum tax. Housing for all.

</div>

<div class="callout danger">

**[Chapter 31: Constitutional Hardball](Section6_Safeguarding_Democracy_And_Accountability/Chapter_31_Constitutional_Hardball.md)**

Day 1 Executive Blitz · Filibuster Elimination · SCOTUS Expansion · DC & PR Statehood · Lock-In Legislation by Month 3. Playing by rules your opponent ignores is a losing strategy.

| | Amendment | Purpose |
|-|-----------|---------|
| **28th** | Voting Rights | Universal right to vote — no disenfranchisement |
| **29th** | Presidential Accountability | No immunity for crimes committed in office |
| **30th** | Citizens United Reversal | Money is not speech; corporations are not people |
| **31st** | Senate Term Limits | Two terms (12 years) maximum |
| **32nd** | Abolish Electoral College | Direct popular vote for President |
| **33rd** | SCOTUS 18-Year Terms | Staggered, predictable appointments every 2 years |
| **34th** | Social Security Protection | Benefits can never be cut; eliminate payroll cap |
