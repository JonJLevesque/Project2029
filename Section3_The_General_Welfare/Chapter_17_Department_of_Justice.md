# Chapter 17: Department of Justice - Radical Reform for Independence and Democracy

## Executive Summary

Project 2025 transformed the Department of Justice into a tool of political persecution and partisan warfare. This chapter outlines a complete overhaul: enforce strict ethical standards, safeguard DOJ's independence from political interference, aggressively defend voting rights, reverse politicized law enforcement, and restore the Department to its constitutional mission—equal justice under law.

## The Project 2025 Damage Assessment

- Inspectors General fired or sidelined
- Whistleblowers retaliated against
- Congressional oversight obstructed
- Document production refused

**Civil Rights Abandonment:**
- Voting Rights Act enforcement ceased
- Police misconduct investigations ended
- Fair housing cases dropped
- LGBTQ+ rights abandoned
- Religious freedom weaponized against minorities

**Criminal Justice Regression:**
- Harsh sentencing policies reinstated
- Private prison contracts expanded
- Clemency and compassion eliminated
- Death penalty expanded
- Reform efforts reversed

### Documented DOJ Weaponization (January 20 - October 15, 2025)

**See Evidence Appendix:** `Supporting_Materials/Evidence_Appendix_Trump_Administration_Violations.md`

The Evidence Appendix documents specific instances of DOJ weaponization with court validation, dates, and actors. Key documented violations include:

**U.S. Attorney Fired for Refusing Political Prosecutions:**
- **Erik Siebert** (EDVA) forced to resign Sept 19-20, 2025 after determining **insufficient evidence** to charge NY AG Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey
- Trump publicly stated **"I want him out"** and later posted **"He didn't quit, I fired him!"**
- Trump posted directly to AG Bondi demanding prosecution: "JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!"
- **Lindsey Halligan** (Trump's former personal lawyer with **ZERO prosecutorial experience**) installed as interim U.S. Attorney

**Politically Motivated Indictments:**

*James Comey (September 25, 2025):*
- Indicted **5 days after Trump's public demand**
- Career prosecutors deemed evidence **insufficient**
- Halligan presented case **alone** to grand jury (career prosecutors refused to participate)
- Grand jury **REJECTED one of three counts** and only **14 of 23 jurors** voted to indict (unusually low)
- Defense challenging as **vindictive prosecution** citing Trump's public demands as prima facie evidence

*Letitia James (October 10, 2025):*
- Indicted on charges related to 2020 mortgage (**$18,933 alleged benefit**)
- Career prosecutors found **insufficient evidence**
- **Ed Martin** (DOJ "weaponization czar") photographed outside James's Brooklyn property during investigation
- Trump had repeatedly called for James to "be arrested and punished"
- James's attorney: "Most blatant and desperate example of political retribution campaign"

**Mass Firing of Prosecutors:**
- Nearly **ALL Public Integrity Unit** attorneys fired
- **75% of Civil Rights Division** attorneys departed (250+ attorneys)
- **ALL January 6 prosecutors** fired with written termination letters explicitly stating they were fired for "prosecuting Jan 6 cases" (calling it "grave national injustice")
- **Sean Brennan** (Jan 6 prosecutor): "In very plain language, it says I was terminated for prosecuting Jan 6 cases...I was retaliated against"
- **Maurene Comey** (James Comey's daughter) fired from SDNY
- **280+ former DOJ employees** signed unprecedented letter warning of "degradation" of constitutional oaths

**Civil Rights Division Gutted:**
- **70% of attorneys departed** (April 2025) under Assistant AG Harmeet Dhillon
- **Voting Section reduced** from ~30 career attorneys to just **3 attorneys**
- Chief Tamar Hagler and five senior managers reassigned to employee complaint office
- Mission changed from racial discrimination enforcement to "fraud, errors, or suspicion," "Keeping Men out of Women's Sports," and "Ending Radical Indoctrination"
- Dhillon told Tucker Carlson: "The crying, the unhappy hours, the mass resignations, the leaking, there's a support group for former civil rights attorneys"
- **8 voting rights lawsuits dismissed** without rationale (cases DOJ had won at district/appeals levels)

**Threatening Letters to Congress:**
- Ed Martin sent **official DOJ threatening letter** to Rep. Robert Garcia after metaphorical CNN comment about Democrats bringing "weapons to this bar fight"
- Letter stated comment "sounds to some like a threat to Mr. Musk" and demanded "clarification" within one week
- Garcia: "It was 100% to silence me...to send a message"
- Similar letters sent to Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Eugene Vindman

**Criminal Investigations of Political Critics:**
- **Sen. Adam Schiff** - mortgage fraud investigation
- **Chris Krebs** - Trump signed memo in Oval Office ordering investigation
- **Miles Taylor** - Trump ordered investigation for "treason"
- **George Soros** - racketeering, terrorism support investigation announced

**AG Bondi's Combative Congressional Testimony (October 7, 2025):**
- **Refused to answer** whether she discussed Comey case with Trump
- Refused to discuss closing Tom Homan bribery investigation
- Called Sen. Schiff **"a liar" and "a failed lawyer"**
- Told Sen. Durbin: "I wish you loved Chicago as much as you hate President Trump"
- Sen. Richard Blumenthal: "Possibly a new low for attorneys general...I have never seen anything close to it"

**Laws Violated:**
- **18 USC § 1503** (obstruction of justice)
- **18 USC § 1512** (witness tampering)
- **18 USC § 241** (deprivation of rights under color of law)
- **5 USC § 2302** (prohibited personnel practices - retaliation)

**Enforcement Status:**
Despite documented violations with written evidence and public statements, **NO officials have been held accountable** as of October 15, 2025. The DOJ itself has been weaponized, eliminating internal accountability mechanisms.

This documented record demonstrates the **urgent necessity** for the structural reforms outlined in this chapter, particularly the 10-year AG term, cause-removal protections, and independence protocols.

## The DOJ Independence Crisis

### Constitutional Principles at Stake

The Department of Justice must serve justice, not presidents. Core principles include:

- **Rule of Law:** No one above the law, including presidents
- **Equal Justice:** Same standards for everyone regardless of politics
- **Prosecutorial Independence:** Decisions based on facts and law, not politics
- **Due Process:** Fair procedures for all
- **Civil Rights Protection:** Aggressive enforcement regardless of political consequences

Project 2025 violated every one.
