# Chapter 17: Department of Justice - Radical Reform for Independence and Democracy

## Executive Summary

Project 2025 transformed the Department of Justice into a tool of political persecution and partisan warfare. This chapter outlines a complete overhaul: enforce strict ethical standards, safeguard DOJ's independence from political interference, aggressively defend voting rights, reverse politicized law enforcement, and restore the Department to its constitutional mission—equal justice under law.

## The Project 2025 Damage Assessment

### Weaponization of Justice

**Political Prosecutions:**
- Investigations opened against political opponents
- Prosecutions dropped for political allies
- Selective enforcement based on partisanship
- Abuse of prosecutorial discretion
- Grand jury process manipulation

**Obstruction of Accountability:**
- Special Counsel investigations undermined
- Inspectors General fired or sidelined
- Whistleblowers retaliated against
- Congressional oversight obstructed
- Document production refused

**Civil Rights Abandonment:**
- Voting Rights Act enforcement ceased
- Police misconduct investigations ended
- Fair housing cases dropped
- LGBTQ+ rights abandoned
- Religious freedom weaponized against minorities

**Criminal Justice Regression:**
- Harsh sentencing policies reinstated
- Private prison contracts expanded
- Clemency and compassion eliminated
- Death penalty expanded
- Reform efforts reversed

## The DOJ Independence Crisis

### Constitutional Principles at Stake

The Department of Justice must serve justice, not presidents. Core principles include:

- **Rule of Law:** No one above the law, including presidents
- **Equal Justice:** Same standards for everyone regardless of politics
- **Prosecutorial Independence:** Decisions based on facts and law, not politics
- **Due Process:** Fair procedures for all
- **Civil Rights Protection:** Aggressive enforcement regardless of political consequences

Project 2025 violated every one.
