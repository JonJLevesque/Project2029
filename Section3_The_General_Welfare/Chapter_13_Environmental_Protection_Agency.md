# Chapter 13: Environmental Protection Agency

## Executive Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency stands at the intersection of public health, environmental protection, and climate action. Project 2025 systematically dismantled five decades of environmental progress: gutting Clean Air and Water Act enforcement, reversing climate regulations, stacking scientific advisory boards with industry representatives, eliminating environmental justice programs, and weakening protection against toxic chemicals and pesticides.

The consequences are measured in premature deaths from air pollution, contaminated drinking water, accelerating climate change, and disproportionate harm to communities of color and low-income Americans. This chapter outlines comprehensive restoration of environmental protection and aggressive action on climate change—the existential threat of our time.

**The Stakes**: Climate change threatens civilization. Air and water pollution kill tens of thousands of Americans annually. Toxic chemicals poison our children. Environmental destruction is irreversible. There is no "do-over" for extinction or climate tipping points. Environmental protection is not a luxury—it's survival.

**Key Reforms**:
- Restore and strengthen Clean Air Act enforcement (criteria pollutants, toxics, mercury)
- Restore and strengthen Clean Water Act protection (WOTUS, point/non-point source pollution)
- Aggressive climate action (power plants, vehicles, methane, HFCs)
- Toxic chemical regulation (PFAS, lead, asbestos, pesticides)
- Environmental justice with enforcement power and resources
- Scientific integrity restoration in all agency decisions
- NEPA restoration for informed decision-making
- Endangered Species Act enforcement
- Adequate EPA staffing, budget, and enforcement capacity
- International climate leadership

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, FIFRA (pesticides), CERCLA (Superfund), RCRA (waste), NEPA, Endangered Species Act, and constitutional authority to protect public health and environment.

## Conclusion: Environmental Protection as Survival

The environment is not a luxury concern for prosperous times—it's survival. Clean air, clean water, a stable climate, and a functioning ecosystem are preconditions for human life, health, and prosperity.

Project 2025 treated environmental protection as an obstacle to profit. The consequences: children poisoned by lead, communities contaminated with PFAS, thousands dying prematurely from air pollution, and climate change accelerating toward catastrophe.

These reforms restore environmental protection as a core government function:

**Clean air to breathe** without fear of asthma, heart attacks, or premature death.

**Clean water to drink** without lead, PFAS, or other toxins.

**A stable climate** where we can grow food, build communities, and pass on a livable planet.

**Protection from toxic chemicals** that poison our children and environment.

**Environmental justice** so all communities, regardless of race or income, have clean air, water, and land.

**Scientific integrity** guiding decisions instead of politics and industry pressure.

The costs are modest—$15 billion annually for EPA, $27 billion annually for infrastructure. The benefits are immense—$500+ billion annually in health, ecosystem services, avoided climate damages, and quality of life.

But more than economics, this is about values: Do we believe our children deserve to grow up without lead poisoning? Do we believe communities of color deserve clean air? Do we believe we have a duty to future generations to leave a livable planet?

Project 2025's answer was no. Project 2029's answer is yes.

The environment is not Democrat or Republican—it's American. We all breathe the same air, drink the same water, and live on the same planet. Environmental protection protects all of us.

These reforms deliver that protection. The science is clear. The solutions exist. The only question is political will.

Future generations will judge whether we rose to this moment. These reforms are our answer.
