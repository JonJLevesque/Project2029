# Chapter 19: Department of Transportation

## Executive Summary

The Department of Transportation (DOT) oversees the movement of people and goods across the United States through nineteen operating administrations, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The department administers approximately $120 billion annually in infrastructure investment, manages safety regulation across all modes of transportation, and implements federal policy governing everything from aviation safety and school bus standards to hazardous materials transport and autonomous vehicle deployment. DOT employs approximately 58,000 workers and oversees infrastructure used by hundreds of millions of Americans daily — the Interstate Highway System's 47,000 miles, the national airspace system handling approximately 45,000 flights per day, the Amtrak national passenger rail network, and the freight rail corridors carrying approximately 40 percent of all U.S. freight ton-miles. Transportation infrastructure is the circulatory system of the American economy, and its quality, safety, and equity determine whether working people can reach jobs, whether goods reach markets, and whether communities are connected to opportunity.

The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 treats the Department of Transportation as an instrument of ideological capture and corporate subsidy. Project 2025 calls for eliminating dedicated transportation funding streams, devolving federal oversight to states under the pretense of "flexibility," stripping safety regulations across aviation, rail, trucking, and motor vehicles, and subordinating public transit to highway expansion for private automobile use. **"The federal government should largely get out of the business of funding local and regional transportation systems,"** *(Project 2025, p. 638)* the document declares, a position that would end transit service for tens of millions of Americans who depend on buses and trains to reach work, medical care, and education. The Trump administration implemented these priorities through a combination of executive orders, regulatory rollbacks, workforce demolition, and deliberate impoundment of congressionally appropriated infrastructure funds in violation of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq.).

This chapter details the systematic dismantling of federal transportation policy between January 2025 and the present, quantifies its human cost in crashes, delayed infrastructure, and lost economic opportunity, and prescribes a comprehensive restoration and transformation agenda for the next Democratic administration. Restoring the Department of Transportation means more than reversing the damage — it means building a twenty-first century transportation system that decarbonizes mobility, closes the racial infrastructure gap, makes aviation and highways safe, and finally delivers the high-speed intercity rail network that peer nations constructed decades ago.

**The Stakes**: Transportation safety failures kill approximately 43,000 Americans annually on highways alone, and aviation near-misses have multiplied against the backdrop of a chronic air traffic controller shortage that the Trump administration worsened by firing hundreds of FAA support workers weeks after a fatal midair collision over Washington, D.C. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA, Pub. L. 117-58) committed $1.2 trillion to rebuild the nation's infrastructure, but the Trump administration impounded billions in violation of the law, deliberately allowing appropriations to lapse rather than obligate funds to communities awaiting road repairs, bridge replacements, transit expansions, and the EV charging network that $5 billion in National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) funding was designed to build. This is not policy disagreement — it is lawlessness in the service of fossil fuel donors and highway industry lobbyists.

**Key Reforms**:
- Restore FAA safety workforce: hire 3,500 net-new air traffic controllers and reinstate wrongfully terminated safety support personnel
- Complete the NEVI EV charging network: obligate all remaining $5 billion in congressionally appropriated funds and establish national charging standards
- Expand Amtrak to a true national passenger rail system, adding service to underserved corridors and pursuing high-speed rail on the Northeast Corridor and Gulf Coast
- Restore and expand transit funding through the Capital Investment Grants program, reversing proposed elimination of $4.2 billion in annual transit capital investment
- Enact the Railway Safety Act, requiring electronically controlled pneumatic brakes on high-hazard trains, wayside detection systems, and two-person crews on all freight trains carrying hazardous materials
- Establish a comprehensive autonomous vehicle safety framework: mandatory crash reporting, pre-deployment safety certification, and human oversight requirements
- Reinstate trucking hours-of-service protections and restore FMCSA enforcement to prevent fatigued driving deaths
- Implement Complete Streets policy as a condition of federal highway funding, requiring safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians
- Electrify the national school bus fleet with dedicated federal funding
- Reform freight rail competition through open access requirements and Surface Transportation Board authority expansion

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8 (Commerce Clause); Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. § 40101 et seq.); Airline Deregulation Act (49 U.S.C. § 41713); Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq.); Federal-Aid Highway Act (23 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.); National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (49 U.S.C. § 30101 et seq.); Amtrak statute (49 U.S.C. § 24101 et seq.); Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-432); Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117-58); Impoundment Control Act (2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq.).

## Part I: Project 2025 DOT Damage and Destruction

### Damage Area 1: Aviation Safety Gutted Through Workforce Destruction

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 called for stripping FAA of its safety culture and reducing its workforce under the guise of eliminating regulatory "red tape." **"The FAA has become an over-regulated, bureaucratic agency that stifles aviation innovation,"** *(Project 2025, p. 641)*. The Trump administration translated this into action with catastrophic speed.

On January 29, 2025, a midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter killed 67 people in the Potomac River near Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the air traffic control tower at DCA was understaffed at the time of the collision — one controller was managing two positions that should have been staffed separately. A supervisor had merged the helicopter control and local control positions at 3:40 p.m., allowing one controller to leave early. The FAA's own data showed DCA's tower was nearly one-third below targeted staffing levels as of September 2023, with a staffing target of 28 Certified Professional Controllers but only 25 CPCs and 3 CPC-In Training available. The Washington Post reported that the staffing level at the time of the crash was "not normal" for that traffic volume.

Weeks after this disaster, the Trump administration through DOGE fired approximately 400 FAA employees in February 2025, including aviation safety assistants, maintenance mechanics, aeronautical information specialists, and enroute charting personnel who maintain and update navigation charts on which pilots depend. The FAA union reported that essential safety-support employees were terminated without individual performance assessments — a violation of civil service regulations that a federal court subsequently confirmed, ordering 132 employees reinstated with back pay. DOGE personnel attempted to extend the firings to air traffic controllers themselves before Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy intervened, a fact reported by Fortune magazine citing internal communications.

The pre-existing ATC staffing crisis is severe by any measure. The FAA employs approximately 14,000 air traffic controllers against a need for approximately 17,500 — a shortfall of 3,500 positions. Of 289 terminal facilities, only 23 meet or exceed full staffing targets. Seventy facilities operate below 65 percent of recommended staffing, forcing controllers to work six-day weeks and 10-hour days. Training a new controller takes three to five years from hiring to independent certification. The Trump administration's response to this inherited crisis was to fire support workers and refuse to fund accelerated recruitment.

The structural failures are systemic, not incidental. The NTSB found that the FAA had failed to regularly evaluate route safety data near DCA and had not implemented recommendations to reduce midair collision risk in the capital's airspace. The Boeing 737 MAX disasters of 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people, established that the FAA's safety certification process had been compromised by delegation of safety decisions to manufacturer representatives without adequate independent oversight. The Trump administration's response to both the DCA disaster and the ongoing structural failures was to accelerate workforce reduction and deregulation, not reform.

Simultaneously, the Trump administration moved to deregulate autonomous vehicle deployment through NHTSA by eliminating crash reporting requirements for self-driving vehicles — removing the transparency mechanism that safety advocates and regulators depend on to detect failure patterns before a disaster forces public scrutiny.

### Damage Area 2: NEVI EV Charging Program Frozen in Violation of Federal Law

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 called for eliminating federal support for electric vehicle infrastructure, deriding EV investment as a market distortion and a subsidy to "politically favored" technology. **"The federal government should not be picking winners and losers in the transportation energy market,"** *(Project 2025, p. 647)*. The Trump administration acted immediately upon this directive.

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed the "Unleashing American Energy" executive order directing federal agencies to pause disbursement of funds appropriated through the IIJA, implicating an estimated $125 billion in unobligated transportation funding. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) rescinded existing NEVI program guidance and froze the disbursement of $5 billion in congressionally appropriated funds to states for electric vehicle charging infrastructure — funds that 50 states had already incorporated into planning and deployment timelines.

The Government Accountability Office found that the administration's actions "constitute an impoundment" in violation of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. A federal district court ruled that DOT and FHWA unlawfully prevented state access to NEVI funds and ordered disbursements to proceed. The administration contested the ruling and delayed compliance. Beyond NEVI, the administration's systematic failure to obligate IIJA grants allowed FY2022 competitive grant awards to lapse, permanently extinguishing funding for community projects that had waited years for federal support.

This pattern of deliberate impoundment extends across DOT programs: competitive grant awards were placed under mandatory review by a March 2025 memo, effectively halting disbursement to cities and states that had received awards. The administration used bureaucratic delay as a tool of policy — starving infrastructure investment that Congress had already authorized and appropriated.

### Damage Area 3: Amtrak Defunded and Intercity Rail Undermined

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 called for privatizing Amtrak, eliminating long-distance routes, and returning intercity rail to the private market. **"Amtrak should be privatized. The federal government has no business operating a railroad,"** *(Project 2025, p. 644)*. This position ignores that Amtrak's national network serves rural communities, that the Northeast Corridor infrastructure is a public asset, and that no private carrier will profitably serve low-density intercity corridors.

The Trump administration's FY2026 budget proposed cutting the Northeast Corridor's federal allocation by 25 percent — from $1.14 billion to approximately $850 million — while nominally preserving operations funding. The administration pulled federal funding from the Dallas-Houston high-speed rail project, a public-private partnership that represented the first true high-speed rail initiative on American soil outside the Northeast. Amtrak's CEO resigned abruptly in March 2025 amid administration threats of further funding cuts. Amtrak subsequently cut 10 percent of its management workforce — approximately 450 jobs — to save $100 million annually in anticipation of federal defunding.

Long-distance Amtrak routes serve millions of Americans who have no viable alternative — rural communities where air service is nonexistent, elderly passengers who cannot fly, and families for whom bus travel is the only option. Defunding these routes eliminates mobility for the most transportation-vulnerable Americans under the pretense of fiscal discipline.

### Damage Area 4: Transit Funding Eliminated, Attacking Urban and Rural Communities Equally

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 proposed eliminating the Capital Investment Grants (CIG) program, the federal government's primary mechanism for funding transit expansion and major rail investments. **"The federal government's role in public transportation should be dramatically reduced. Transit systems are local services and should be funded locally,"** *(Project 2025, p. 639)*. This position ignores that federal transit investment has generated trillions in economic returns and that transit access is foundational to low-income workers' ability to participate in the economy.

The Trump administration's FY2026 budget proposed eliminating the CIG program, which provided $4.2 billion to local transit authorities in FY2023 and funds light rail expansions, bus rapid transit corridors, and subway extensions across dozens of American cities. It simultaneously proposed eliminating core FTA formula funding that transit agencies depend on for maintenance and operations.

The claim that transit is purely local ignores the structure of federal transportation finance: for small urban and rural transit systems, the federal government provided 45 percent of operations funds and more than 70 percent of capital funds in 2024. Eliminating federal transit support does not devolve policy to localities — it eliminates service entirely in communities where local tax bases cannot substitute for federal investment.

### Damage Area 5: Trucking Deregulation and Highway Safety Rollbacks

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 called for rolling back hours-of-service regulations for commercial truck drivers, eliminating proposed speed limiter mandates, and reducing FMCSA enforcement activity. The document characterized safety regulations as burdens on industry competitiveness rather than protections for working drivers and the public. **"Many motor carrier safety regulations have exceeded their statutory mandate and impose costs without commensurate safety benefits,"** *(Project 2025, p. 652)*.

The Trump administration implemented Secretary Duffy's "Pro-Trucker Package," which expanded sleeper berth split arrangements to permit "6/4" and "5/5" configurations allowing drivers more flexibility in scheduling driving hours — flexibility that highway safety advocates warn will enable longer total driving days despite the changes being presented as neutral adjustments. The administration canceled proposed truck speed limiter mandates that safety engineers had projected would save hundreds of lives annually. FMCSA enforcement case initiations dropped by approximately 60 percent compared to prior administration levels, reducing accountability for carriers with poor safety records.

Fatal truck crashes have increased. Large trucks weighing up to 80,000 pounds kill approximately 5,000 Americans per year in crashes. Fatigued driving is a documented and major contributing factor in commercial vehicle crashes, and the entire regulatory architecture of hours-of-service rules exists because the industry, left to self-regulate, worked drivers to the point of incapacitation.

### Damage Area 6: School Bus Safety Standards and Highway Safety Deregulation

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 proposed eliminating federal minimum safety standards for school buses and devolving school bus procurement standards to states and localities, framing federal safety requirements as federal overreach into education policy. The practical effect of this devolution would be to allow financially stressed school districts to purchase the cheapest available buses regardless of safety performance. National school bus safety standards set under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (49 U.S.C. § 30101 et seq.) and administered by NHTSA establish minimum crashworthiness, rollover protection, and emergency exit requirements that protect approximately 26 million children who ride school buses daily — the largest public transportation system in the United States.

The Trump administration's NHTSA simultaneously shelved pedestrian safety rulemakings that would have required automatic emergency braking for pedestrians on new passenger vehicles, delayed implementation of rear-visibility camera standards for heavy vehicles, and reduced the agency's rulemaking docket by withdrawing dozens of proposed rules that had been under development. NHTSA's vehicle safety enforcement budget was reduced, and the agency's Office of Defects Investigation — responsible for detecting and investigating safety defects that lead to recalls — lost experienced staff through DOGE-directed buyouts.

Highway deaths in the United States reached approximately 43,000 annually in recent years, a toll that far exceeds peer nations with comparable vehicle ownership rates. The difference is not technology — it is policy. Countries that mandate automatic emergency braking, enforce speed limits through automated enforcement, and invest in separated bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure achieve dramatically lower fatality rates. The Trump administration moved in the opposite direction, canceling safety rulemakings and reducing enforcement while claiming to protect "freedom" on American roads.

### The Human Cost

The aggregate human cost of Project 2025's transportation agenda is measured in lives, dollars, and foreclosed opportunity:

- **67 people killed** in the January 29, 2025 midair collision at Reagan National Airport, in a context of documented ATC understaffing that the administration subsequently worsened
- **3,500 ATC shortfall** positions that the administration made no meaningful effort to fill, leaving 70 facilities operating below 65 percent of recommended staffing and forcing controllers to work 10-hour days, six days a week
- **400 FAA employees fired** through DOGE in February 2025, weeks after the DCA disaster, including safety-critical support staff whose terminations a federal court found violated civil service regulations
- **$5 billion** in NEVI EV charging funding frozen in violation of federal law, delaying a nationwide charging network by years and stranding state agencies that had committed to deployment timelines
- **$125 billion** in total IIJA infrastructure funding subject to "Unleashing American Energy" pause order, with an estimated $125 billion in unobligated transportation funds placed under administrative review
- **25 percent cut** to Northeast Corridor funding threatening service on the nation's busiest rail corridor, used by approximately 12 million passengers annually; Amtrak CEO resigned amid funding threats
- **$4.2 billion** in annual transit capital investment proposed for elimination, threatening rail and bus expansion projects in dozens of cities and elimination of bus service in rural areas where federal funds cover most operating costs
- **60 percent drop** in FMCSA enforcement case initiations, leaving dangerous carriers on the road with impunity while large truck fatalities have increased
- Hundreds of millions in IIJA competitive grants at risk of lapsing due to deliberate administrative inaction, extinguishing locally planned projects that communities spent years developing
- **Autonomous vehicle crash reporting eliminated**, removing the transparency mechanism needed to identify safety failures before commercial deployment produces mass casualties
- **Airline passenger rights rules rescinded**, restoring hidden fees and eliminating automatic refund rights for the approximately 900 million passengers flying U.S. domestic carriers annually

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Damage Area 7: Aviation Deregulation and Airline Passenger Rights Erosion

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 proposed weakening airline consumer protection requirements and rolling back DOT's authority to fine airlines for deceptive practices and to enforce passenger rights rules. **"DOT's consumer protection authority has been expanded far beyond its statutory basis and should be returned to its traditional scope,"** *(Project 2025, p. 645)*. This position ignores a decade of demonstrated airline industry abuses — hidden fees, deliberate overbooking, denial of refunds during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the proliferation of "junk fees" that inflate ticket costs by hundreds of dollars per passenger.

The Biden administration had used DOT's statutory authority under 49 U.S.C. § 41712 to issue landmark consumer protection rules requiring automatic cash refunds for canceled and significantly changed flights, banning certain hidden fees, and mandating family seating without additional charges. The Trump administration moved to rescind or weaken these protections, framing them as regulatory burdens on the airline industry rather than baseline protections for consumers.

The airline industry's consolidation — from more than a dozen major carriers in 2000 to four carriers controlling approximately 80 percent of domestic air travel — means that market competition cannot substitute for regulation. When American, Delta, Southwest, and United Airlines all impose the same hidden fees on passengers who have no other realistic travel option, the market has failed and only regulatory enforcement of passenger rights provides any protection.

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

Congress's authority to regulate transportation flows from Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution — the Commerce Clause — which grants Congress power to regulate commerce among the states. Aviation, interstate rail, interstate trucking, and the national highway system are quintessentially interstate commercial activities. The Supreme Court affirmed sweeping federal transportation authority in Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1 (1824), establishing that navigation and transportation affecting interstate commerce fall within Congress's plenary power.

The Spending Clause (Art. I, § 8, cl. 1) authorizes Congress to attach conditions to federal grants to states, which is the legal basis for requiring states to meet safety and planning standards as a condition of receiving federal highway and transit funds. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), confirmed Congress's broad authority to condition transportation grants on compliance with federal policy objectives.

The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq.) prohibits the executive branch from withholding congressionally appropriated funds except through formal rescission or deferral procedures subject to congressional review. The Trump administration's freeze of NEVI funds and delay of IIJA grants without following these procedures violated this statute, as the GAO confirmed.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. § 40101 et seq.)**: Establishes FAA authority over civil aviation, including airspace management, air traffic control, aircraft certification, airman certification, and aviation safety. Section 40101(d) states the FAA shall give "highest priority" to assigning, maintaining, and enhancing safety in air commerce. Section 44722 requires the FAA to conduct regular reviews of aviation safety and to take corrective action when safety standards are not being met. Section 44702 authorizes the FAA to issue type certificates for aircraft, and the standards for delegation of certification authority to manufacturers are established under 14 C.F.R. Part 21.

**Federal-Aid Highway Act (23 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.)**: Establishes the federal-aid highway system, authorizes federal apportionments to states for highway construction and maintenance, and sets safety and environmental conditions on federal funding.

**Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq.)**: Declares it U.S. policy to encourage and promote public transportation; authorizes FTA formula programs, Capital Investment Grants, and transit safety oversight. Section 5301(b) establishes that "it is in the interest of the United States to encourage and promote the development of transportation systems embracing various modes of transport."

**National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (49 U.S.C. § 30101 et seq.)**: Authorizes NHTSA to establish Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), require recall of defective vehicles, and enforce motor vehicle safety. Section 30102 defines safety as the highest priority.

**Amtrak Statute (49 U.S.C. § 24101 et seq.)**: Establishes Amtrak as a for-profit corporation with a national public service mission, authorizes federal capital and operating grants, and requires Amtrak to operate a national rail passenger system. Section 24101(b) declares it U.S. policy that "intercity rail passenger transportation is an essential component of a national intermodal transportation system."

**Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-432)**: Requires positive train control (PTC) on high-risk rail lines, establishes crew size requirements on certain operations, and expands FRA enforcement authority.

**Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117-58)**: Appropriates $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure investment, including $5 billion for NEVI, $66 billion for rail, $39 billion for transit, and $110 billion for roads and bridges.

**Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Statute (49 U.S.C. § 31101 et seq.)**: Establishes FMCSA authority over commercial motor vehicles, including hours-of-service regulations (49 C.F.R. Part 395), driver qualification standards, and carrier safety ratings. Section 31136 requires FMCSA to prescribe regulations on commercial vehicle safety that ensure, among other things, that drivers are not impaired by fatigue. Section 31144 authorizes FMCSA to issue orders placing carriers deemed to be imminent hazards out of service.

**Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (Pub. L. 117-328)**: Enacted guaranteed paid sick leave for freight rail workers, a right that major Class I carriers had resisted in contract negotiations and that was imposed by Congress following the near-national rail strike of 2022. Enforcement of this right by DOT and FRA is a priority for the incoming administration.

### Rail Safety Legal Framework

The Federal Railroad Safety Act (49 U.S.C. § 20101 et seq.) authorizes FRA to issue safety regulations covering track, equipment, operating practices, and hazardous materials transportation. Section 20101 declares that "the purposes of this chapter are to promote safety in every area of railroad operations and reduce railroad-related accidents and incidents." FRA authority extends to mandating electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes, wayside detection systems, and crew size on trains carrying hazardous materials. The 2023 East Palestine, Ohio derailment — in which a Norfolk Southern train carrying vinyl chloride and other toxic chemicals derailed, spilled, and burned — demonstrated the lethal consequences of regulatory gaps that the rail industry had successfully lobbied to create. Rail safety regulations proposed in the aftermath of East Palestine remain unenacted, blocked by industry lobbying.

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), also within DOT, sets regulations under 49 U.S.C. § 5103 for the transport of hazardous materials by all modes, including the classification and packaging requirements that determine how dangerous chemical cargoes are handled on trains. The 2015 rulemaking on "high-hazard flammable trains" was a landmark that the rail industry weakened through sustained lobbying; the East Palestine train carrying vinyl chloride was not classified as a high-hazard flammable train and thus not subject to the more stringent brake and routing requirements that might have prevented or mitigated the derailment.

### Impoundment Control Act and IIJA Fund Protection

The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq.) establishes two mechanisms by which the President may propose to withhold congressionally appropriated funds: a rescission, which requires congressional approval within 45 days, and a deferral, which Congress can disapprove by resolution. The Act expressly prohibits the executive from simply declining to spend appropriated funds without following these procedures. The Supreme Court's decision in Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35 (1975), confirmed that the executive does not have inherent constitutional authority to impound funds over congressional objection.

The Trump administration's freeze of NEVI funds and delay of IIJA competitive grants did not follow either the rescission or deferral procedures — it simply stopped spending money that Congress had appropriated, in direct violation of the statute. The GAO confirmed this in its 2025 opinion. Any future administration seeking to impound transportation funds must follow statutory procedures or face legal challenge; the next administration must not only unfreeze the funds but must establish enforcement mechanisms to prevent future administrations from repeating this violation.

### Aviation Consumer Protection Legal Framework

DOT's authority to regulate airline consumer practices flows from 49 U.S.C. § 41712, which prohibits air carriers and ticket agents from engaging in unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition. DOT has broad rulemaking authority under this provision to define what constitutes an unfair or deceptive practice, as confirmed by Spirit Airlines, Inc. v. DOT, 687 F.3d 403 (D.C. Cir. 2012), which upheld DOT's authority to require all-in fare disclosure. Congress's commerce power over interstate aviation is plenary; the Airline Deregulation Act (49 U.S.C. § 41713), while preempting state laws related to "rates, routes, or services," does not preempt federal consumer protection authority and does not prevent Congress from enacting new statutory passenger rights provisions.

## Part III: Comprehensive DOT Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: Aviation Safety Workforce Restoration and FAA Structural Reform

The FAA faces a generational safety crisis rooted in chronic ATC understaffing, deferred safety technology investment, and a safety culture degraded by political interference. Restoring aviation safety requires immediate workforce investment and structural reform.

#### Air Traffic Controller Hiring Surge

Issue an Executive Order directing the FAA to hire no fewer than 1,800 new air traffic controller trainees per year for five years, funded through existing DOT appropriations and supplemental appropriations requests. The FAA academy at Oklahoma City must be expanded to accommodate accelerated training cohorts. Establish a dedicated ATC Workforce Emergency Fund within the first 100 days through supplemental appropriations legislation, providing $3 billion over five years for hiring, training, facility modernization, and competitive compensation to retain certified professional controllers.

Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 40122, the FAA Administrator shall establish ATC staffing standards that require all facilities to reach 90 percent of recommended staffing within four years, with quarterly public reporting on progress. No facility shall be permitted to operate below 75 percent staffing except under emergency circumstances with mandatory reporting to Congress within 30 days.

#### FAA Safety Culture Reform

Commission an independent investigation by the NTSB into the systemic FAA safety culture failures that contributed to the January 2025 DCA midair collision, the 737 MAX disasters, and the pattern of runway incursions at major airports. Direct the FAA Administrator to implement all NTSB recommendations within 180 days of issuance. Reinstate the FAA Safety Management System (SMS) rulemaking for commercial air carriers (14 C.F.R. Part 5), accelerating mandatory SMS adoption timelines for all Part 121 carriers.

Restructure the FAA's Aircraft Certification Office to fully separate safety certification from industry relationship management, ending the practice of delegating safety certification decisions to manufacturer designees without independent FAA verification. This reform addresses the structural failure identified in the 737 MAX investigations and documented in the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's 2020 final committee report, which found that the FAA's "culture of concealment" from its own safety oversight personnel allowed the 737 MAX's MCAS system to receive certification despite known risks.

Establish a permanent Aviation Safety Advisory Panel consisting of NTSB investigators, aviation safety experts with no current industry employment, airline pilot union representatives, and aircraft maintenance union representatives, with authority to conduct unannounced reviews of FAA safety certification processes and report directly to Congress and the DOT Inspector General. The panel shall meet quarterly and issue public reports on any FAA safety certification concerns it identifies.

Propose legislation establishing mandatory minimum criminal penalties for aviation company executives who knowingly conceal safety defects from FAA certification officials, creating individual accountability that supplements the corporate fines that the Boeing 737 MAX settlement established as insufficient deterrence. The aviation industry's response to the MAX disasters was inadequate in part because the financial penalties — while large in absolute terms — were absorb-able as a cost of business by a company with Boeing's scale and government contracts.

#### Aviation Safety Technology Investment

Direct $2 billion from unobligated IIJA infrastructure funds for NextGen air traffic management technology upgrades, runway incursion detection systems at all Class B and Class C airports, and terminal automation modernization. Mandate installation of ATC conflict alert systems at all facilities lacking them within 24 months pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 44502.

### Reform II: NEVI and EV Infrastructure Network Completion

The $5 billion NEVI program represents the most significant federal investment in transportation energy infrastructure since the Interstate Highway System. Its completion is not optional — it is essential to achieving the climate and energy security goals that informed its enactment.

#### Immediate Fund Obligation

Issue an Executive Order on Day One directing FHWA to reinstate all state NEVI plans as approved under the program's original guidance, lift all administrative freezes on fund disbursements, and obligate all remaining appropriated NEVI funds within 90 days. Appoint an EV Infrastructure Coordinator within the Office of the Secretary to oversee compliance. Direct the DOT Inspector General to investigate the prior administration's freeze for Impoundment Control Act violations and refer findings to the Department of Justice as appropriate.

Expand the NEVI program through supplemental legislation to $10 billion total, adding rural fast-charging corridors, urban multiunit-dwelling charging support, and grid interconnection grants to ensure that EV charging infrastructure reaches all communities, not only those along major interstate corridors. Establish charging reliability standards requiring NEVI-funded stations to achieve 97 percent uptime, with penalties for noncompliance and consumer-facing real-time availability data.

#### Electrification Beyond Highways

Pair NEVI expansion with a national school bus electrification initiative: $5 billion in grants to school districts and state transportation agencies to replace diesel school buses with electric vehicles, prioritizing districts in communities with high rates of childhood asthma and respiratory illness attributable to diesel exhaust. Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 5310, expand Clean Mobility grants for rural and elderly community transportation to include EV fleet support.

### Reform III: Amtrak National Expansion and High-Speed Rail

The United States remains the only major industrialized democracy without a national high-speed rail network. The next administration will change this through sustained investment, institutional reform, and the political will to build.

#### Restore and Expand Amtrak Funding

On Day One, restore all proposed cuts to Amtrak's Northeast Corridor capital allocation, returning NEC funding to $1.14 billion per year and supplementing it with $2 billion annually in IIJA rail funds for Gateway Program tunnel construction under the Hudson River — the single most critical infrastructure project in the United States, without which the NEC cannot achieve reliable service. Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 24104, direct Amtrak to develop a comprehensive national network expansion plan within 180 days identifying corridors for new or enhanced service, with priority given to the Gulf Coast restoration (New Orleans to Orlando), the Sunset Limited corridor, and midwestern state corridors.

Reinstate federal funding for the Dallas-Houston high-speed rail project and direct FRA to expedite environmental review pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 22907's existing authority to fund intercity passenger rail corridor development.

#### True High-Speed Rail

Establish a National High-Speed Rail Authority as a government corporation under 49 U.S.C. § 24101 et seq., analogous to Amtrak's structure, with authority to plan, fund, and oversee construction of dedicated high-speed rail infrastructure on at least three initial corridors: Northeast Corridor improvements to achieve true high-speed service (220+ mph), California High-Speed Rail federal funding restoration, and a new Midwest corridor connecting Chicago to Detroit, Cleveland, and Columbus. Propose legislation committing $50 billion over 10 years in federal high-speed rail investment, with federal participation at 80 percent of project costs.

The case for high-speed rail is economic, environmental, and strategic. The Northeast Corridor already carries approximately 12 million Amtrak passengers annually and generates more economic activity per route mile than any other passenger corridor in the country. Travel demand between Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington far exceeds what air travel can serve efficiently. High-speed rail on that corridor at 220 mph average speeds would take market share from the most congested airspace in the United States, reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions, and generate tax revenue that substantially offsets infrastructure investment costs. Japan, France, Germany, Spain, China, and dozens of other countries built their high-speed rail networks through sustained federal investment over decades; the United States has the same capacity and a greater need. The next administration will stop treating high-speed rail as an impossible aspiration and treat it as the national infrastructure priority it is.

Require that all high-speed rail projects funded under the National High-Speed Rail Investment Act use American-made rolling stock, track, and signaling systems under Buy America requirements strengthened pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 24405, creating manufacturing employment in states that currently lack significant passenger rail industry presence. Establish competitive grant programs to support the development of American high-speed rail manufacturing capacity, reducing dependence on foreign rolling stock suppliers and building the industrial base for long-term maintenance and expansion.

### Reform IV: Transit Investment for All Communities

Public transit is not a luxury — it is the infrastructure that connects working people to employment, healthcare, education, and opportunity. The next administration will reverse the proposed elimination of transit capital investment and dramatically expand federal transit support.

#### Restore and Expand Capital Investment Grants

Restore the CIG program at full funding and expand it to $6 billion annually through supplemental appropriations, creating a pipeline for light rail, bus rapid transit, subway, and commuter rail expansion projects in communities of all sizes. Issue an Executive Order directing FTA to prioritize CIG awards for projects in Environmental Justice communities as defined by Executive Order 12898 and its successors, ensuring that transit investment reaches the communities most dependent on public transportation.

#### Rural and Small Urban Transit

Create a dedicated Rural Transit Emergency Fund of $2 billion annually within FTA, supplementing the existing Rural Area formula program (49 U.S.C. § 5311) with resources sufficient to fund both operations and capital for transit-dependent rural communities. Establish a national transit-on-demand pilot program providing microtransit service in rural counties where fixed-route transit is not economically viable, serving elderly, disabled, and low-income riders who have no transportation alternatives.

#### Transit Equity and Workforce

Issue a Complete Streets Executive Order conditioning all federal-aid highway funds under 23 U.S.C. § 133 on state and local Complete Streets policies that require bicycle lanes, pedestrian facilities, and transit priority as standard elements of roadway design. Direct FHWA to update the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) to establish federal standards for protected bicycle infrastructure and pedestrian crossing treatments. Fund transit workforce development through a Transit Careers Initiative, providing $500 million in grants to transit agencies, community colleges, and unions to recruit, train, and certify transit workers, addressing the bus driver shortage that has reduced service frequency across the country.

The racial geography of American transportation investment is not accidental. For decades, federal highway planning destroyed Black neighborhoods through urban highway routing — a pattern documented in Robert Moses's handling of the Cross Bronx Expressway, in the destruction of Rondo in St. Paul, in the routing of I-10 through New Orleans' Tremé — while denying transit investment to the same communities. The next administration will use the DOT Office of Civil Rights, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000d), and the environmental justice provisions of Executive Order 12898 to audit existing federal transportation investment patterns and condition new awards on demonstrated commitment to equitable service distribution. Establish a Transportation Equity Index within FTA and FHWA tracking transit service quality, pedestrian infrastructure quality, and transportation cost burden by race and income across metropolitan areas, with annual public reporting and consequences for persistent inequities in states receiving federal transportation funds.

#### Transit Accessibility for Disabled Americans

The Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.) requires that public transit systems be fully accessible to people with disabilities, but FTA enforcement of ADA transit compliance has been chronically underfunded and understaffed. Direct FTA to conduct a national Transit Accessibility Audit covering all transit systems receiving federal formula funds, identifying stations and vehicles not in compliance with ADA requirements, and establishing binding remediation timelines with federal funding support. Authorize $1 billion in targeted ADA transit compliance grants, prioritizing systems serving the highest proportion of elderly and disabled riders. Direct DOT's Disability Rights Section to increase complaint investigation staff by 50 percent within two years.

### Reform V: Rail Safety — East Palestine and Beyond

The February 3, 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio demonstrated the consequences of regulatory capture in freight rail safety. A Norfolk Southern train carrying vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, and other hazardous materials derailed, spilled, and burned, contaminating air, soil, and waterways and forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. The rail industry had spent years lobbying against the safety rules that might have prevented it.

#### Enact the Railway Safety Act

Propose and advocate for passage of the Railway Safety Act, requiring:
- Electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) braking systems on all trains carrying hazardous materials, pursuant to FRA authority under 49 U.S.C. § 20141
- Wayside detection systems at intervals not to exceed 25 miles on mainline track used by trains carrying hazardous materials
- Mandatory two-person crews on all freight trains carrying hazardous materials or operating at speeds exceeding 50 mph
- Enhanced community notification requirements for hazmat train routes, including real-time public information systems
- Expanded FRA authority to impose civil penalties of up to $100,000 per violation per day on carriers with chronic safety violations

#### Strengthen FRA Enforcement

Issue an Executive Order directing FRA to increase track inspection frequency to the maximums authorized under 49 C.F.R. Part 213, double the number of FRA safety inspectors through accelerated hiring, and establish a dedicated Hazmat Rail Safety Division within FRA with authority to order train holds pending safety inspections. Direct FRA to complete the long-pending rulemaking on cold weather operations that was initiated following the 2012 derailment of a crude oil train in Casselton, North Dakota.

The East Palestine derailment established that the existing railroad safety regulatory framework contains structural gaps that the rail industry has exploited through lobbying. Norfolk Southern identified the East Palestine train's wheel bearing as defective hours before the derailment — a wayside detector system registered overheating — but the threshold for emergency stop was not triggered until the bearing reached catastrophic failure. The FRA had the authority to require tighter detection thresholds and had received recommendations to do so; it did not act. The next administration will establish a formal NTSB recommendation tracking and response system within FRA, requiring that all NTSB recommendations be publicly acknowledged within 90 days and acted upon within 18 months, with a waiver process requiring public justification for any recommendation not implemented.

Direct PHMSA, in coordination with FRA, to complete a comprehensive Hazmat by Rail Safety Rule updating classification thresholds, rerouting requirements, and emergency response notification standards for all chemical commodities transported by rail, prioritizing those that the East Palestine investigation identified as inadequately regulated under current rules. The rulemaking shall be completed within 24 months using PHMSA's statutory authority under 49 U.S.C. § 5103.

### Reform VI: Autonomous Vehicle Safety Framework

The deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads without adequate safety standards represents one of the most significant emerging risks in transportation policy. The Trump administration's elimination of crash reporting requirements for autonomous vehicles removed the foundational data collection on which safety regulation depends.

#### Establish Safety-First AV Framework

Issue an Executive Order directing NHTSA to reinstate mandatory incident and crash reporting for all autonomous vehicle test and commercial deployments within 30 days. Propose legislation establishing the Autonomous Vehicle Safety Act, requiring:
- Pre-deployment safety certification for all Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous vehicle systems, pursuant to NHTSA's authority under 49 U.S.C. § 30111
- Mandatory reporting of all crashes, near-misses, and disengagements to NHTSA within 48 hours
- Independent third-party safety audits before and during commercial deployment
- Clear liability standards establishing manufacturer responsibility for automated driving system failures
- Civil penalty authority of up to $500 million for systematic misrepresentation of autonomous vehicle safety performance

#### Human Oversight Requirements

Require that all commercially deployed autonomous vehicle systems maintain a remote human monitoring capability and immediate takeover protocol until NHTSA certifies that the system has achieved safety performance equivalent to or better than the median human driver across a validated set of driving scenarios. Permit phased exemptions from Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for autonomous vehicles only upon demonstration of compliance with the safety certification framework, reversing the blanket exemption expansion pursued by the Trump administration.

The autonomous vehicle industry's lobbying for regulatory forbearance rests on the claim that their technology is safer than human drivers. If that claim is true, it is verifiable — and the only reason to resist mandatory crash reporting and third-party safety certification is that the industry cannot substantiate its safety claims to independent review. The Trump administration's NHTSA, by eliminating the reporting requirements that would generate verifiable safety data, protected the industry from the accountability that safety requires. The next administration will reverse this and require that autonomous vehicle manufacturers prove their safety claims to independent evaluators before deploying their systems on public roads shared by children, cyclists, and pedestrians who never consented to serve as test subjects.

#### Autonomous Vehicle Equity and Accessibility

Direct NHTSA to evaluate whether autonomous vehicle deployment plans account for the needs of elderly and disabled Americans for whom AV technology represents a potential mobility revolution — but only if deployment is structured to serve their needs rather than to maximize profit on profitable routes. Require that all commercial AV service operators receiving federal support or operating on federally funded infrastructure provide ADA-compliant service and serve low-income communities at the same or lower cost as serving affluent communities.

### Reform VII: Highway Safety and Trucking Reform

American highways kill approximately 43,000 people annually — a death toll that rivals wars and that federal policy has the power to substantially reduce. The Trump administration's rollback of trucking safety standards and collapse of FMCSA enforcement moved in precisely the wrong direction.

#### Restore Hours-of-Service Protections

Issue an Executive Order directing FMCSA to rescind the "Pro-Trucker Package" modifications to hours-of-service regulations (49 C.F.R. Part 395) that permit extended driving through sleeper berth manipulation, and to reinstate the 2020 hours-of-service rules as the minimum safety floor. Propose rulemaking to further strengthen hours-of-service protections based on updated fatigue science, incorporating biomathematical fatigue modeling as a required element of hours-of-service analysis pursuant to FMCSA's authority under 49 U.S.C. § 31136.

#### Speed Limiters and Crash Avoidance

Reinstate the rulemaking for mandatory speed limiter installation on heavy commercial vehicles at 65 mph, a rule that DOT's own analysis projected would save approximately 200 lives annually. Direct NHTSA to mandate automatic emergency braking (AEB) on all new heavy trucks pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 30111, accelerating the timeline previously set for AEB rulemaking.

#### FMCSA Enforcement Restoration

Direct FMCSA to restore enforcement case initiation to at least 2023 baseline levels within 90 days, with a goal of doubling enforcement activity within two years. Establish a High-Risk Carrier Task Force within FMCSA with authority to order carriers off the road pending compliance with safety ratings pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 31144. Fund 500 additional FMCSA safety inspectors through emergency hiring authority.

### Reform VII-A: Transportation Decarbonization

Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, accounting for approximately 28 percent of total domestic GHG emissions as of 2022 according to EPA data. Within the transportation sector, light-duty vehicles account for the largest share, followed by medium- and heavy-duty trucks, aviation, and rail. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act together represented the most significant federal investment in transportation decarbonization in American history — and the Trump administration systematically dismantled both.

#### Reinstate Vehicle Emissions Standards

Issue an Executive Order directing EPA and NHTSA, jointly pursuant to their authority under 42 U.S.C. § 7521 (Clean Air Act) and 49 U.S.C. § 32902 (Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards), to reinstate and strengthen the vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards and CAFE standards that the Trump administration rescinded. Direct EPA to restore California's authority to set vehicle emissions standards exceeding federal minimums under Section 209 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. § 7543), which the Trump administration wrongly revoked, allowing the other seventeen states that follow California's standards to maintain their more stringent requirements.

Direct NHTSA to issue a final rule requiring all new passenger vehicles sold in the United States to achieve a fleet-average fuel economy of 55 miles per gallon by 2030 and to meet annual GHG intensity reduction milestones through 2035, consistent with the scientific consensus on the emission reductions required to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. These standards create the demand signal that drives automotive industry investment in electrification and efficiency.

#### Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Aviation Decarbonization

Aviation accounts for approximately 3 percent of U.S. GHG emissions but has a warming impact roughly three times its CO2 contribution due to high-altitude contrails and nitrogen oxide effects. Establish a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) federal procurement program requiring that fuel used on all federal government flights be at least 20 percent SAF by 2028, building market volume for domestic SAF production. Propose a SAF blender's tax credit and production incentive to scale domestic SAF manufacturing to at least 3 billion gallons annually by 2030.

Direct FAA to develop a national aviation decarbonization roadmap pursuant to its authority under 49 U.S.C. § 44502, identifying the combination of fleet renewal, SAF deployment, operational efficiency improvements, and infrastructure investment needed to achieve net-zero aviation emissions by 2050, with 10-year interim targets beginning in 2030.

#### Freight Rail Decarbonization

Freight rail is already the most energy-efficient mode of surface freight transportation, generating approximately three times fewer greenhouse gas emissions per ton-mile than trucking. Expanding freight rail's market share relative to trucking is itself a climate strategy. Direct the STB and FRA to conduct a joint study within 18 months on regulatory, infrastructure, and economic barriers to freight rail capacity expansion, identifying measures that would shift cargo currently transported by diesel trucks to rail — reducing both emissions and highway wear.

Establish a federal program funding demonstration projects for hydrogen-powered and battery-electric freight locomotives, building on Class I railroad commitments to locomotive fleet decarbonization. Provide $500 million in grants through FRA's existing grant authority to fund locomotive technology demonstration projects, with preference for projects that include domestic manufacturing commitments and labor agreements.

### Reform VIII: Airline Passenger Rights and Aviation Consumer Protection

The consolidation of the U.S. airline industry into four dominant carriers controlling approximately 80 percent of domestic air travel has eliminated the competitive pressure that once served as an alternative to regulation. DOT's consumer protection authority under 49 U.S.C. § 41712 — which prohibits unfair and deceptive practices in air transportation — provides the legal foundation for a comprehensive passenger rights agenda.

#### Codify and Expand Passenger Protections

Issue an Executive Order on Day One directing DOT to reinstate and enforce all consumer protection rules that were rescinded or weakened by the Trump administration, including automatic cash refund requirements for canceled flights, family seating requirements, and fee disclosure mandates. Direct DOT to propose expanded passenger rights rules within 180 days covering: (1) mandatory compensation for flight delays exceeding two hours that are within carrier control, comparable to European Union Rule 261/2004 standards; (2) prohibition on fare increases between booking and ticketing; (3) mandatory disclosure of total all-in fares in initial search results; (4) guaranteed rebooking rights on competitor airlines for significant delays.

Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 46301, direct DOT to increase civil penalties for consumer protection violations and establish a dedicated passenger rights enforcement unit within the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection with authority to initiate investigations without a consumer complaint trigger.

#### Airline Consolidation Review

Direct the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, in coordination with DOT, to conduct a comprehensive review of the competitive effects of airline industry consolidation on routes, fares, and service quality — particularly in communities with limited airport options. The review shall evaluate whether existing statutory authority supports structural remedies for routes where a single carrier exercises monopoly or near-monopoly pricing power, and shall report to Congress with legislative recommendations within one year.

### Reform IX: Freight Rail Competition and Shipper Rights

The concentration of the U.S. freight rail industry into four Class I railroads — BNSF, Union Pacific, CSX, and Norfolk Southern — each with near-monopoly control over their respective regional networks, has produced high rates, poor service reliability, and chronic underinvestment in the labor and infrastructure that safe operations require. Approximately 70 percent of shippers in the United States have only one freight rail carrier available to them, meaning they accept the carrier's terms or shift to truck freight — which costs more, pollutes more, and damages roads at far higher rates than rail. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) has authority to address these failures but has lacked the will and resources to exercise it.

#### Open Access Framework

Propose the Freight Rail Competition Act establishing open access requirements that allow short-line railroads and competing carriers to access Class I infrastructure on regulated terms, modeled on the European Union's open access framework that has dramatically increased rail freight competition. Direct the STB to complete long-pending rulemakings on reciprocal switching, enhanced service standards, and shipper remedies for service failures pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 11102.

#### STB Capacity and Enforcement

Propose legislation expanding the STB from five to seven members, with dedicated staff authority to conduct audits of Class I rail carrier service and safety performance. Establish minimum service standards for freight rail with civil penalty authority for persistent underperformance, incentivizing the operational improvements that shippers, agricultural exporters, and manufacturing industries have long demanded.

#### Worker Rights and Rail Labor

Issue an Executive Order directing DOT and FRA to enforce labor protections for freight rail workers, including guaranteed sick leave rights established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 and protection from retaliation for reporting safety violations under 49 U.S.C. § 20109. The chronic shortage of freight rail workers — which contributed to service failures, longer trains with fewer crew members, and the fatigue-driven risks documented in East Palestine post-mortems — reflects decades of workforce suppression by carriers who cut labor costs at the expense of safety and service. Propose legislation extending federal employee protection provisions to all workers in the freight rail supply chain, including short-line employees who lack the collective bargaining power of Class I workers.

Class I railroads have pursued a decades-long program of reducing train crew sizes from three or four workers to two, and in some cases have sought to operate trains with a single engineer. FRA proposed a minimum crew size rule of two persons under the Biden administration; the rule was contested by industry and the Trump administration subsequently withdrew it. The next administration will finalize minimum crew size requirements under 49 U.S.C. § 20102, establishing that trains carrying hazardous materials must operate with at minimum two certified crew members, and that single-person operations are not permitted on high-speed or high-density corridors. The safety rationale is clear: two-person crews provide redundancy in emergencies, better situational awareness for the train's location and condition, and faster response to mechanical failures — as the East Palestine incident demonstrated, where the train's mechanical condition was deteriorating for miles before the derailment.

### Reform X: DOT Institutional Integrity and Project 2025 Capture Prevention

The Trump administration's use of DOT as an instrument to impound funds, redirect infrastructure investment based on political loyalty rather than need, and suppress safety regulation in favor of industry donors requires structural reform to prevent recurrence.

#### Institutionalizing Grant Award Integrity

Issue an Executive Order establishing that all DOT competitive grant awards shall be made based on published merit criteria, that no political approval above the program office level is required for individual awards, and that grant awards shall be publicly documented with scoring justifications within 30 days of award. Direct the DOT Inspector General to audit any grant award reversal or modification that occurs after initial scoring is complete, with findings made public within 90 days. These requirements address the documented pattern of the Trump administration redirecting or canceling grants to communities represented by Democratic members of Congress.

#### Protecting Career Safety Workforce

Direct all DOT sub-agencies to establish Safety-Critical Personnel Classifications identifying all positions whose functions directly affect transportation safety outcomes, and requiring that any reduction-in-force of safety-critical personnel receive independent safety impact review and congressional notification before taking effect. This protection, enacted by regulation under existing DOT authority and proposed as statutory language in supplemental legislation, prevents a recurrence of the DOGE-driven firing of FAA safety workers without safety impact assessment.

Establish an independent DOT Safety Oversight Board composed of former NTSB members, aviation and rail safety experts, and consumer safety advocates, with authority to review and publicly comment on any proposed regulatory rollback that affects transportation safety. The Board shall have no veto authority — preserving executive flexibility — but its public findings shall be required before any safety-related final rule can take effect, creating an accountability mechanism that makes regulatory rollbacks harder to execute quietly.
