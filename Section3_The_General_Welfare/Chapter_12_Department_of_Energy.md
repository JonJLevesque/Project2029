# Chapter 12: Department of Energy and Related Commissions

## Executive Summary

The Department of Energy stands at the center of America's energy transformation—from fossil fuels to clean energy, from climate crisis to climate solution, from energy insecurity to energy independence through renewables. Project 2025 reversed this transformation: slashing clean energy R&D, propping up failing fossil fuel industries, delaying grid modernization, weakening efficiency standards, and subordinating science to political and industry interests.

The consequences: slower renewable energy deployment, continued climate pollution, expensive and unreliable grid, energy costs higher than necessary, and falling behind international competitors in clean energy economy. Meanwhile, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) were captured by industries they regulate or paralyzed by political interference.

This chapter outlines comprehensive energy transformation: accelerating clean energy deployment, modernizing the grid, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, strengthening efficiency standards, realigning FERC and NRC with public interest, advancing nuclear safety and innovation, and ensuring energy justice.

**The Energy Transformation Imperative:**

Climate science demands energy sector transformation. Clean energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels. Energy security requires domestic renewable energy, not foreign oil. Economic competitiveness demands leadership in trillion-dollar clean energy economy. Energy justice requires affordable, reliable, clean power for all communities.

**Key Reforms**:
- Triple clean energy R&D investment ($15 billion annually)
- Deploy 500+ GW of renewable energy by 2030
- Modernize transmission grid ($150 billion investment)
- Eliminate $20+ billion in annual fossil fuel subsidies
- Restore and strengthen appliance and building efficiency standards
- FERC transmission reforms enabling renewable integration
- NRC safety-first approach and advanced reactor licensing
- Energy justice ensuring affordable clean energy for all
- Critical mineral supply chains for clean energy
- National lab revitalization for climate and energy innovation
- International clean energy cooperation and competition

**Legal Basis**: Department of Energy Organization Act, Federal Power Act, Atomic Energy Act, Energy Policy Act, energy efficiency statutes, and constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce and promote general welfare.

## Part I: Project 2025 Energy Policy Failures

### Clean Energy R&D Slashed

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The Department of Energy's mission—energy innovation, national security, environmental quality—was subordinated to fossil fuel industry interests:

**Research Cuts:**
- Clean energy R&D budget cut 70% (from $10 billion to $3 billion)
- Solar research: 85% cut
- Wind research: 80% cut
- Energy storage: 75% cut
- Grid modernization: 70% cut
- Building efficiency: 80% cut
- Electric vehicle technology: 90% cut

**Fossil Fuel Favoritism:**
- Fossil fuel R&D increased
- "Clean coal" zombie program revived (despite repeated failures)
- Carbon capture for coal plants subsidized (enabling continued coal burning)
- Oil and gas industry given taxpayer subsidies
- Research on renewable energy integration obstacles, not solutions

**National Labs Redirected:**
- National laboratories redirected from clean energy to fossil fuels
- Climate research defunded
- Scientists offered buyouts or reassigned
- International competitiveness research ended
- Long-term research projects canceled

**The Innovation Gap:**
- U.S. fell behind China, EU in clean energy technology
- Lost market share in solar panels, wind turbines, batteries
- Venture capital fled to countries supporting clean energy
- Brain drain: scientists and engineers left for private sector or overseas
- Technology leadership squandered

### Grid Modernization Stalled

**Transmission Delays:**
Project 2025 slowed desperately needed grid modernization:

**Transmission Bottlenecks:**
- Renewable energy projects can't connect to grid (years-long interconnection queues)
- Regional transmission planning prevented (states blocked interstate lines)
- FERC reforms delayed or weakened
- Cost allocation disputes unresolved
- Permitting process not streamlined

**Grid Reliability Failures:**
- Extreme weather events (Texas freeze, California fires) revealed grid vulnerabilities
- Aging infrastructure (transformers, transmission lines from 1960s-70s)
- Insufficient investment in resilience
- Cybersecurity vulnerabilities
- Distributed energy resources (rooftop solar, batteries) not integrated

**Consequences:**
- Clean energy projects delayed years waiting for transmission
- $billions in renewable energy investment stalled
- Fossil fuel plants kept operating because no transmission for replacements
- Grid reliability declining
- Energy costs higher than necessary

### Fossil Fuel Subsidies Preserved

**The Corporate Welfare for Big Oil:**

Despite climate crisis and renewable energy superiority, Project 2025 preserved fossil fuel subsidies:

**Tax Subsidies:**
- Intangible drilling costs deduction: $1.5 billion annually
- Percentage depletion allowance: $1 billion annually
- Domestic manufacturing deduction: $1 billion annually
- Last-in, first-out (LIFO) accounting: $500 million annually
- Other tax breaks: $5+ billion annually

**Direct Spending:**
- Fossil fuel leasing on public lands (below-market rates)
- Fossil fuel infrastructure
- Export assistance for oil and gas
- R&D for "clean fossil fuels" (oxymoron)
- Strategic Petroleum Reserve purchases

**Hidden Subsidies:**
- Externalized environmental and health costs
- Climate change damages
- Pollution cleanup (often taxpayer-funded)
- Military protection of oil supply chains
- Health costs from air pollution

**Total: $20-50 billion annually depending on methodology**

**The Injustice:**
- Fossil fuel industry among most profitable in history
- Subsidizing industry destroying livable climate
- Renewable energy receives far less support despite superiority
- Taxpayers subsidizing their own poisoning

### Efficiency Standards Weakened

**Appliance and Equipment Standards:**
Project 2025 systematically weakened efficiency standards that save consumers money and reduce emissions:

**Rollbacks:**
- Light bulbs: Rejected LED requirements
- Dishwashers: Weakened water and energy efficiency
- Washing machines: Weakened efficiency standards
- Showerheads: Eliminated flow restrictions (Trump's personal obsession)
- Furnaces and water heaters: Delayed efficiency improvements
- Commercial equipment: Broad delays and weak

enings

**Procedures Sabotaged:**
- Delayed mandatory updates to standards
- Changed methodology to undervalue consumer savings
- Ignored climate benefits
- Accepted industry data without scrutiny
- Blocked state standards (California and others)

**Consumer and Climate Costs:**
- Consumers paid billions more in energy bills
- Emissions millions of tons higher
- Energy waste continued
- Competitive disadvantage (other countries advancing efficiency)

**The Absurdity:**
Efficiency standards are win-win: consumers save money, emissions decline, businesses innovate, utilities avoid costly generation capacity. Yet Project 2025 treated them as tyranny while subsidizing fossil fuel pollution.

### FERC Captured and Paralyzed

**Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Failures:**

FERC regulates interstate electricity transmission, wholesale power markets, and natural gas pipelines. Under Project 2025, it failed its public interest mission:

**Transmission Stalled:**
- Failed to reform transmission planning and cost allocation
- Allowed states to block interstate transmission
- Slow permitting for critical lines
- Inadequate incentives for needed investment
- Renewable energy interconnection backlog

**Market Manipulation:**
- Power markets favored fossil fuels despite higher costs
- Capacity markets paid coal and gas plants to sit idle
- Ignored state renewable energy policies
- Resisted integrating distributed energy resources
- Transmission charges favored incumbent utilities

**Pipeline Rubber Stamping:**
- Approved virtually every gas pipeline despite climate crisis
- Dismissed climate impacts
- Overrode state and local objections
- Expedited industry applications
- Ignored alternatives

**Lack of Independence:**
- Commissioners closely tied to energy industry
- Revolving door between FERC and regulated industries
- Decisions favoring industry over consumers and climate
- Limited public participation

### NRC Safety Lapses and Innovation Obstruction

**Nuclear Regulatory Commission Failures:**

NRC's dual mission—safety and promotion of nuclear energy—created conflicts. Under Project 2025:

**Safety Concerns:**
- Aging reactor oversight weakened
- License extension approvals rushed
- Safety culture erosion
- Cybersecurity vulnerabilities ignored
- Emergency planning inadequate

**Waste Stalemate:**
- No progress on high-level nuclear waste disposal
- Temporary storage growing at reactor sites
- Yucca Mountain revival failed (Nevada opposition)
- Consolidated interim storage stalled
- No long-term solution after 75 years of nuclear power

**Advanced Reactor Licensing Delays:**
- Small modular reactors delayed by regulatory uncertainty
- Advanced designs (molten salt, high-temperature gas) lacked clear pathway
- International competitors advancing faster (China, Russia)
- Innovation stifled by process designed for 1970s reactors
- Private investment deterred

**The Nuclear Dilemma:**
Nuclear power is carbon-free but creates waste lasting millennia, has catastrophic accident potential, and faces economics unfavorable compared to renewables. Project 2025 neither ensured safety, solved waste, nor enabled innovation.

### Energy Justice Ignored

**Environmental Justice in Energy:**

Low-income communities and communities of color bear disproportionate energy burdens:

**High Energy Costs:**
- Low-income households spend 3-4x higher percentage of income on energy
- Older, inefficient housing
- Inability to invest in efficiency improvements
- Predatory electricity disconnection practices
- Limited access to rooftop solar and other distributed energy

**Pollution Exposure:**
- Power plants, refineries, pipelines disproportionately sited in communities of color
- Air pollution from fossil fuel combustion
- Water pollution from coal ash and fracking
- Health impacts: asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease
- Climate change impacts disproportionately harm vulnerable communities

**Project 2025 Failures:**
- No energy justice office or programs
- No consideration of distributional impacts
- Fossil fuel favoritism perpetuated pollution in overburdened communities
- Efficiency programs cut, harming low-income households
- Clean energy tax credits favored affluent homeowners

## Conclusion: The Energy Transformation

Energy transformation is climate imperative, economic opportunity, security necessity, and justice requirement.

Project 2025 resisted this transformation, clinging to fossil fuel past. Result: slower progress, continued pollution, lost economic opportunities, and falling behind international competitors.

Project 2029 embraces transformation:

**Clean energy deployed at scale**, creating millions of jobs and ending climate pollution from electricity sector.

**Grid modernized** to integrate renewables, improve reliability, and empower consumers.

**Efficiency standards** saving consumers hundreds of billions while reducing emissions.

**Fossil fuel subsidies eliminated**, ending taxpayer support for climate destruction.

**Nuclear energy** managed safely with waste solutions and advanced reactors developed responsibly.

**Energy justice** ensuring all communities benefit from clean energy transition.

**Technology leadership** reclaimed through research and manufacturing investments.

The energy transformation is underway globally. Question is whether America leads or follows. Project 2029 chooses leadership.

Clean energy is cheaper, cleaner, healthier, more secure, and creates more jobs than fossil fuels. Energy transformation is not sacrifice—it's upgrade.

Future generations will inhabit the world our energy choices create. These reforms ensure that world is livable, prosperous, and just.
