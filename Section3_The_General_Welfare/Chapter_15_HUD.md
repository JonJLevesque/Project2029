# Chapter 15: Department of Housing and Urban Development
## Social Housing and the Right to a Home

## Executive Summary

Housing is a human right, not a commodity for speculation. Project 2025 gutted fair housing enforcement, abandoned public housing investment, accelerated evictions, and criminalized homelessness—all while housing costs consumed ever-larger shares of working families' incomes and homelessness reached record levels.

This chapter outlines a fundamental transformation of American housing policy: adopting the Vienna/Singapore social housing model where government provides high-quality, mixed-income housing as a public good; implementing Housing First to eliminate chronic homelessness within five years; preempting exclusionary zoning that blocks housing production; stabilizing rents to prevent displacement; and integrating green building standards for environmental justice.

**The Stakes**: 650,000 Americans are homeless on any given night. 50% of renters are cost-burdened (paying more than 30% of income on housing). There's a shortage of 7 million affordable units. Working families are one crisis away from the street, while Wall Street landlords extract billions in rents and speculators drive up prices. Housing should be a human right—not a profit center.

**Key Reforms**:
- **National Social Housing Program**: Vienna/Singapore model—30%+ of housing stock as public/social housing, mixed-income, high-quality
- **Housing First**: Permanent housing for all homeless individuals; eliminate chronic homelessness in 5 years
- **Community Land Trusts**: Permanent affordability through nonprofit land ownership
- **Anti-NIMBY Preemption**: Federal override of exclusionary zoning near transit
- **Rent Stabilization**: Enable local rent control, anti-gouging protections, just cause eviction
- **Fair Housing Restoration**: AFFH reinstatement, source-of-income protection, algorithm auditing
- **Green Affordable Housing**: Net-zero new construction, deep retrofits, environmental justice

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3601-3619), Housing and Community Development Act, McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, Commerce Clause (housing markets are interstate commerce), Spending Clause (condition federal funds), Supremacy Clause (preemption of discriminatory local laws).

**Investment**: $74 billion annually for transformative housing policy.

## Part I: Project 2025 Housing Destruction

### The Assault on Fair Housing

**What Project 2025 Did:**

**Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) Rule Rescinded:**
- Obama's 2015 AFFH rule required HUD-funded jurisdictions to assess and address patterns of segregation
- Trump administration repealed the rule in 2020
- Project 2025 ensured no reinstatement
- Result: Segregation perpetuated with federal funding

**HUD Civil Rights Staff Gutted:**
- Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) staff reduced
- Discrimination investigations dropped
- Testing programs eliminated
- Pattern and practice cases abandoned
- Result: Housing discrimination enforcement collapsed

**Source of Income Discrimination Allowed:**
- Landlords can refuse Section 8 vouchers in most states
- No federal prohibition on source-of-income discrimination
- Voucher holders concentrated in high-poverty areas
- Result: Vouchers fail to enable mobility to opportunity neighborhoods

### The Affordable Housing Crisis

**Public Housing Disinvestment:**
- Capital fund cut by 50%+
- Operating subsidies reduced
- RAD (Rental Assistance Demonstration) conversions accelerated without tenant protections
- NYCHA alone: $40 billion in unmet capital needs
- Public housing stock deteriorating nationwide

**Section 8 Funding Stagnation:**
- Only 1 in 4 eligible families receives assistance
- Wait lists: 2-10 years in most cities
- Voucher values don't keep pace with market rents
- Project-based Section 8 contracts expiring without renewal

**Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Inadequacy:**
- Primary federal affordable housing production tool
- Produces only 100,000 units annually (need: 500,000+)
- 15-year affordability period—then units convert to market rate
- Benefits investors, not communities

**The Affordability Emergency:**
- 50%+ of renters cost-burdened (paying >30% of income on housing)
- 25% of renters severely cost-burdened (paying >50%)
- Median rent increased 30%+ since 2019
- Homeownership increasingly unattainable (median home: $400K+)
- One medical bill, job loss, or crisis away from eviction

### The Homelessness Catastrophe

**Point-in-Time Count (2024):**
- 650,000+ Americans homeless on any given night
- 127,000+ chronically homeless
- 35,000+ veterans homeless
- 72,000+ families with children
- Highest levels since tracking began

**Project 2025's Response: Criminalization**
- Supported Supreme Court decision allowing cities to criminalize sleeping outdoors
- Funded "homeless sweeps" that destroy belongings, disrupt services
- No investment in permanent housing solutions
- Shelters instead of homes (cycling through crisis, not solving it)

**Root Causes Ignored:**
- Wage stagnation + rent inflation = can't afford housing
- Mental health/addiction services gutted
- Domestic violence survivors lack safe housing
- LGBTQ+ youth rejected by families
- Foster care to streets pipeline
- Incarceration to streets pipeline

### The Speculation Economy

**Wall Street Landlords:**
- Institutional investors own 30%+ of single-family rentals in some markets
- Private equity: Blackstone, Invitation Homes, American Homes 4 Rent
- Bought distressed properties after 2008, now raising rents 10-20% annually
- Aggressive eviction practices
- No community accountability

**Speculation and Flipping:**
- Investors buy, hold briefly, flip for profit
- Drives up prices without adding housing supply
- Displaces long-term residents
- Neighborhoods as profit centers, not communities

**Short-Term Rentals:**
- Airbnb/VRBO remove housing from rental market
- 1 million+ units removed nationally
- Drives up rents in tourist areas
- Hollows out communities

---

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Framework

### Federal Authority Over Housing

**Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3601-3619):**
- Prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, disability
- Section 3608(e)(5): HUD Secretary shall "administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of this subchapter"
- *Texas Department of Housing v. Inclusive Communities* (2015): Disparate impact claims valid under FHA

**Housing and Community Development Act:**
- Authorizes CDBG (Community Development Block Grants)
- Authorizes HOME Investment Partnerships
- Condition federal funds on fair housing compliance
- Provides framework for federal housing investment

**McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act:**
- Authorizes Continuum of Care (CoC) grants
- Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG)
- Federal authority to address homelessness
- Can be directed toward Housing First approaches

**Commerce Clause:**
- Housing markets are interstate commerce
- Construction materials, financing, migration all cross state lines
- Federal authority to regulate housing markets

**Spending Clause:**
- Congress can condition federal funds on state/local policy compliance
- Transportation funding conditioned on zoning reform
- HUD funding conditioned on fair housing

**Supremacy Clause:**
- Federal law preempts conflicting state/local law
- FHA preempts discriminatory local housing policies
- Can preempt exclusionary zoning that violates fair housing

### Key Precedents

***Texas Department of Housing v. Inclusive Communities* (2015):**
- Disparate impact claims valid under Fair Housing Act
- Policies with discriminatory effects violate FHA even without discriminatory intent
- Crucial for challenging exclusionary zoning

***Hills v. Gautreaux* (1976):**
- Housing remedies can cross jurisdictional lines
- Regional approaches to desegregation permissible
- Foundation for regional housing authorities

***Arlington Heights v. Metro Housing* (1977):**
- Discriminatory intent standard for Equal Protection claims
- But FHA disparate impact provides alternative theory
- Burden-shifting framework for housing discrimination

***Lindsey v. Normet* (1972):**
- No fundamental right to housing under Constitution
- **BUT**: Congress can create statutory rights
- States can recognize right to housing

## Part III: The Social Housing Model

### Reform I: National Social Housing Program

**The International Evidence:**

**Vienna, Austria:**
Vienna has provided high-quality social housing for 100 years—and it works.

| Metric | Vienna |
|--------|--------|
| Social/public housing share | 60% of residents |
| Average rent (social housing) | 20-25% of income |
| Quality | Indistinguishable from market |
| Mixed-income | Required—all income levels |
| Wait list | Months, not years |
| Homelessness rate | Near-zero |

**How Vienna Does It:**
- City owns land (critical—land costs eliminated)
- Limited-profit housing associations build/manage
- Cross-subsidization: higher-income tenants pay more, subsidize lower-income
- No stigma: middle class lives in social housing
- Quality standards enforced: attractive, well-maintained
- Long-term investment: buildings designed for 100+ years

**Singapore:**
80% of Singapore's population lives in HDB (Housing Development Board) public housing.

| Metric | Singapore |
|--------|-----------|
| Public housing share | 80% of population |
| Homeownership rate | 90%+ (99-year leases) |
| Quality | High-rise, modern, well-maintained |
| Mixed-income | Required |
| Ethnic integration | Mandated quotas |
| Wait time | 3-4 years for new flats |

**How Singapore Does It:**
- Government land acquisition (enables affordability)
- Central Provident Fund (retirement accounts) used for down payments
- 99-year leases (not fee simple—government retains land)
- Resale market regulated to prevent speculation
- Comprehensive planning: housing + transit + amenities

**Finland:**
Finland is the only EU country to reduce homelessness—through Housing First.

| Metric | Finland (2024) |
|--------|----------------|
| Chronic homelessness | Near-zero |
| Housing First success rate | 80%+ |
| Approach | Permanent housing immediately, then services |
| Cost | LOWER than shelters + emergency services |

**The American Model: Social Housing Trust Fund**

**Policy Design:**

**1. Social Housing Trust Fund:**
- **Annual appropriation:** $50 billion (mandatory spending)
- **Capitalization:** Dedicated revenue from wealth tax, carbon tax
- **Permanence:** Trust fund structure protects from annual appropriations fights
- **Federal-regional partnerships:** Regional housing authorities administer locally

**2. Unit Production Targets:**
| Timeframe | Units Produced | Cumulative |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Year 1 | 100,000 | 100,000 |
| Year 2 | 150,000 | 250,000 |
| Year 3 | 200,000 | 450,000 |
| Year 4 | 200,000 | 650,000 |
| Year 5 | 200,000 | 850,000 |
| Year 10 | — | 1,500,000 |
| Year 20 | — | 3,000,000 |

**Target: 30% of housing stock as social housing by 2050**

**3. Mixed-Income Requirements:**
All social housing developments must include:
| Income Level | Share of Units | Rent |
|--------------|---------------|------|
| Very Low Income (<30% AMI) | 30% | 30% of income |
| Low Income (30-50% AMI) | 30% | 30% of income |
| Moderate Income (50-80% AMI) | 20% | 30% of income |
| Middle Income (80-120% AMI) | 20% | Below market (75%) |

**Why Mixed-Income:**
- Eliminates stigma (not "projects")
- Cross-subsidization (higher rents help fund lower rents)
- Social integration (diverse neighbors)
- Political durability (middle class has stake)
- Higher quality (market competition)

**4. Geographic Distribution:**
- **Location requirements:** Near jobs, transit, services
- **Not concentrated poverty:** Scattered-site and mixed-income mandatory
- **Opportunity areas:** Priority for high-opportunity neighborhoods
- **Regional approach:** Housing authorities operate across municipal boundaries

**5. Governance:**
- **Regional Housing Authorities:** Operate at metropolitan/regional level (bypass local NIMBYism)
- **Resident representation:** Tenant councils with board seats
- **Professional management:** Trained property managers, maintenance staff
- **Transparent waiting lists:** First-come, first-served with priority categories

**6. Quality Standards:**
- **Design standards:** Attractive architecture, community spaces, amenities
- **Durability:** Built for 100+ years (Vienna standard)
- **Energy efficiency:** Net-zero or near-net-zero (see Part VIII)
- **Accessibility:** Universal design, ADA+
- **Maintenance:** Funded capital reserves for ongoing maintenance

**Legal Basis:**
- Spending Clause: Federal grants to housing authorities
- Commerce Clause: Housing markets are interstate commerce
- Housing Act of 1937: Existing public housing authority
- Model: Public housing system created during New Deal, expanded post-WWII

### Reform II: Community Land Trusts

**What Are Community Land Trusts?**

Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are nonprofit organizations that:
- Acquire land and hold it permanently
- Sell or lease buildings on the land at affordable prices
- Retain ownership of land, ensuring permanent affordability
- Governed by residents and community members

**How CLTs Maintain Affordability:**

**Traditional Homeownership:**
- Buy house for $200,000
- Sell 10 years later for $400,000
- Pocket $200,000 appreciation
- Next buyer can't afford $400,000
- Affordability lost

**CLT Homeownership:**
- Buy house for $150,000 (land cost removed)
- Lease land from CLT for minimal amount
- Sell 10 years later under resale formula
- Keep some appreciation (e.g., 25%)
- Next buyer pays affordable price (e.g., $200,000)
- Affordability preserved forever

**Successful CLT Examples:**

**Champlain Housing Trust (Burlington, VT):**
- Largest CLT in U.S.
- 3,000+ housing units
- Affordable forever
- Foreclosure rate: <1% (vs. 7% national average during 2008 crisis)

**Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (Boston, MA):**
- Community-controlled development
- 225 units of affordable housing
- Urban agriculture, community spaces
- Model for community power

**Policy Design:**

**Federal CLT Development Fund: $10 billion annually**
- Land acquisition grants
- Technical assistance for new CLT formation
- Capacity building for existing CLTs
- Low-interest loans for development

**Federal Land Disposition Preference:**
- Surplus federal land offered first to CLTs
- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac REO properties to CLTs
- Tax-foreclosed properties to CLTs

**Tax Incentives:**
- Enhanced charitable deduction for land donations to CLTs
- Property tax exemption for CLT land (already common in states)
- Capital gains exclusion for sales to CLTs

**CDBG/HOME Integration:**
- CLT development eligible for all HUD programs
- Preference in competitive grants
- Technical assistance funding

---

### Reform III: Housing First Homelessness Elimination

**The Evidence Is Clear:**

Traditional homelessness response: "Housing readiness"
- Require treatment, sobriety, employment BEFORE housing
- Shelter cycling: in and out, never stable
- Success rate: 40-50%
- Cost: High (emergency rooms, jails, shelters)

**Housing First:**
- Permanent housing IMMEDIATELY
- Wrap-around services AFTER housed
- No preconditions (sobriety, treatment, employment)
- Success rate: 80-90%
- Cost: LOWER than traditional approach

**Why Housing First Works:**
- Stability enables recovery (can't address addiction while homeless)
- Dignity and autonomy (people make better choices with stability)
- Cost-effective (fewer ER visits, jail stays, shelter nights)
- Humane (treats people as people, not problems)

**Utah's Success:**
- Implemented Housing First in 2005
- Chronic homelessness reduced 91% by 2015
- Cost savings: $8,000-$12,000 per person annually
- Model for national implementation

**Finland's Success:**
- Only EU country to reduce homelessness
- Built 4,600 permanent supportive housing units
- Chronic homelessness nearly eliminated
- Shelters converted to permanent housing

**Policy Design:**

**National Housing First Act: $20 billion annually**

**1. Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH):**
- **Target:** 100,000 new PSH units over 5 years
- **For:** Chronically homeless individuals (homeless 1+ year or 4+ episodes)
- **Model:** Scattered-site apartments with case management
- **Services:** Mental health, addiction treatment, job training, life skills
- **No preconditions:** Housing provided first, services offered (not required)

**2. Rapid Rehousing:**
- **Target:** 200,000 households annually
- **For:** Families and individuals with episodic homelessness
- **Model:** Short-term rental assistance (3-24 months)
- **Services:** Case management, employment assistance
- **Goal:** Stabilize, then transition to permanent affordability

**3. Prevention:**
- **Emergency rental assistance:** Prevent evictions that lead to homelessness
- **Legal services:** Tenant representation in eviction proceedings
- **Mediation:** Landlord-tenant dispute resolution
- **Diversion:** Problem-solving at shelter entry point

**4. Target: Functional Zero Chronic Homelessness in 5 Years**
- **Year 1:** 25,000 PSH placements, 50,000 rapid rehousing
- **Year 2:** 50,000 PSH placements (75,000 cumulative), 50,000 rapid rehousing
- **Year 3:** 75,000 PSH cumulative, 50,000 rapid rehousing
- **Year 4:** 100,000 PSH cumulative, 50,000 rapid rehousing
- **Year 5:** Functional zero chronic homelessness in 25+ cities/regions

**"Functional Zero" Definition:**
- Homelessness is rare, brief, and non-recurring
- When it occurs, there's immediate access to housing
- Community has capacity to house anyone who becomes homeless
- Not "zero" (impossible) but effectively solved

**5. Convert Shelters to Housing:**
- Phase out emergency shelters as primary response
- Convert shelter facilities to permanent housing where feasible
- Redirect shelter funding to permanent solutions
- Emergency shelters remain for extreme weather, crisis only

**Implementation:**
- Coordinated entry systems: Single point of access, prioritization
- By-name lists: Know every homeless individual, track progress
- Data-driven: Real-time dashboards, outcome tracking
- Federal-local partnership: HUD sets standards, locals implement

---

### Reform IV: Rent Stabilization Framework

**The Problem:**

**State Preemption:**
- 21 states preempt local rent control entirely
- Local communities cannot protect tenants
- Result: No limits on rent increases, no just cause eviction
- Displacement accelerating in hot markets

**No Tenant Protections:**
- Month-to-month tenants can be evicted for any reason
- 30-day notice (or less) to vacate
- Rent increases unlimited
- No relocation assistance

**Policy Design:**

**1. Override State Preemption:**
- Federal legislation enabling local rent stabilization
- Supremacy Clause preempts state laws blocking local action
- Restores local control over housing policy

**Legal Basis:**
- Commerce Clause: Rental housing market is interstate commerce
- Fair Housing Act: Displacement has disparate impact on protected classes
- Spending Clause: Condition HUD/transportation funds on allowing local rent stabilization

**2. Anti-Gouging Standards:**
- **Cap:** Annual rent increases limited to inflation + 3% (or 5%, whichever is lower)
- **Trigger:** Applies to buildings 15+ years old (exempts new construction)
- **Exceptions:** Capital improvements (amortized), substantial rehabilitation
- **Enforcement:** Tenant right of action, penalty for violations

**3. Just Cause Eviction:**
- Landlords must have legitimate reason to evict:
  - Non-payment of rent
  - Lease violation (after notice and opportunity to cure)
  - Nuisance/illegal activity
  - Owner move-in (with relocation assistance)
  - Substantial rehabilitation (with right of return)
  - Condo conversion (with relocation assistance)
- Retaliation prohibited
- Relocation assistance required for no-fault evictions

**4. Tenant Right to Renew:**
- Tenants in good standing have right to renew lease
- Cannot be displaced simply because lease expires
- Provides stability for families, children in schools

**5. Relocation Assistance:**
- If displaced for owner move-in, rehab, or conversion:
- Relocation payment: 3 months' rent
- 90-day notice minimum
- Right of first return after rehabilitation

**Note:** Federal framework ENABLES local action—does not mandate rent control nationally. Respects federalism while removing barriers to local tenant protection.

---

### Reform V: Anti-NIMBY Zoning Preemption

**The Problem:**

**Exclusionary Zoning:**
- 75% of residential land in major metros zoned single-family only
- Minimum lot sizes: 1-5 acres in suburbs
- No apartments, townhouses, or affordable housing allowed
- Result: Housing shortage, segregation, sprawl

**NIMBYism:**
- "Not In My Back Yard"
- Wealthy homeowners block any new development
- Use zoning, environmental review, lawsuits to delay/kill projects
- Result: No housing built where it's needed most

**Economic Segregation:**
- High-opportunity areas (good schools, jobs, transit) exclude affordable housing
- Working families pushed to distant, under-resourced areas
- Reinforces racial and economic segregation
- Violates Fair Housing Act through disparate impact

**Policy Design:**

**1. Transit-Accessible Area Preemption:**
- **Requirement:** Within 1/2 mile of transit stations, as-of-right multifamily zoning required
- **"As-of-right":** No discretionary approval process, ministerial review only
- **Density:** Minimum density standards (e.g., 50 units/acre within 1/4 mile, 30 units/acre within 1/2 mile)
- **Preemption:** Federal law supersedes local zoning in transit areas
- **Transit definition:** Rail stations, BRT, frequent bus service (15-minute headways)

**2. Condition Transportation Funding:**
- Federal transportation funding (highway, transit) conditioned on zoning reform
- Jurisdictions must allow multifamily housing near transit to receive full funding
- Phased implementation: 3-year compliance window
- Enforcement: 10-25% funding reduction for non-compliance

**3. ADU Legalization:**
- Require all states/localities to allow accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on single-family lots
- No owner-occupancy requirement
- No parking minimums for ADUs
- Ministerial approval (no discretionary process)

**4. Parking Minimum Reform:**
- Prohibit mandatory parking minimums within 1/2 mile of transit
- Reduce parking requirements for affordable housing
- Allow unbundled parking (tenants choose whether to pay for parking)
- Result: Lower construction costs, more housing

**5. CEQA/NEPA Streamlining for Housing:**
- Categorical exclusions for infill affordable housing
- Ministerial approval for projects meeting affordability standards
- Environmental review cannot be used to block compliant housing
- Preserve environmental review for greenfield development

**Legal Basis:**
- **Commerce Clause:** Housing production affects interstate commerce (materials, labor, migration)
- **Fair Housing Act:** Exclusionary zoning perpetuates segregation, has disparate impact
- **Spending Clause:** Condition transportation/housing funds
- **Precedent:** Fair Housing Act already preempts discriminatory local laws

**Constitutional Defense:**
The Commerce Clause gives Congress broad authority to regulate activities substantially affecting interstate commerce. Housing markets clearly qualify:
- Construction materials shipped across state lines
- Mortgage financing is interstate
- Workers migrate for jobs (housing affects labor markets)
- Housing costs affect economic competitiveness

*See Gonzales v. Raich* (2005): Congress can regulate local activities if they substantially affect interstate commerce in the aggregate.

---

### Reform VI: Fair Housing Restoration

**1. Reinstate Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) Rule:**

**What AFFH Requires:**
- Jurisdictions receiving HUD funds must:
  - Assess fair housing conditions (segregation, disparities, barriers)
  - Identify contributing factors
  - Set measurable goals
  - Take meaningful actions to address segregation
- Submit Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) to HUD
- HUD reviews and provides feedback
- Progress tracked and enforced

**Enforcement:**
- **Non-compliance:** HUD can withhold funds from non-compliant jurisdictions
- **Pattern and practice:** DOJ can bring enforcement actions
- **Private right of action:** Residents can sue under FHA

**2. Source of Income Protection:**

**Problem:**
- Landlords refuse to rent to Section 8 voucher holders
- Legal in most states (no federal prohibition)
- Voucher holders concentrated in high-poverty areas
- Perpetuates segregation

**Solution:**
- Federal prohibition on source-of-income discrimination
- Section 8 vouchers accepted everywhere
- Includes all lawful income: disability, social security, child support
- Enforcement: HUD complaints, private right of action

**3. Algorithm Auditing:**

**Problem:**
- Mortgage lending increasingly uses algorithmic underwriting
- Algorithms can perpetuate bias (trained on historical data)
- "Black box" decisions—applicants don't know why denied
- Disparate impact likely

**Solution:**
- Require disclosure of algorithmic factors in lending decisions
- Regular audits for disparate impact
- Burden on lenders to prove non-discrimination
- Penalties for algorithmic discrimination

**4. Enforcement Capacity:**

**Current State:**
- HUD FHEO understaffed
- Investigation backlogs
- Testing programs inadequate
- Pattern and practice cases rare

**Reform:**
- Triple HUD FHEO staff
- Dedicated housing discrimination testing unit
- Coordinate with DOJ Civil Rights Division
- Increase fair housing grants to local agencies
- Mandatory settlement reviews

**Budget:** $500 million annually for fair housing enforcement

---

### Reform VII: Green Affordable Housing

**Climate and Housing Justice:**

**The Problem:**
- Low-income housing often oldest, least efficient
- Energy burden: Low-income households pay 3x higher share of income on energy
- Health hazards: Lead, asbestos, mold disproportionately affect low-income residents
- Climate vulnerability: Affordable housing often in flood zones, extreme heat areas
- Environmental racism: Toxic facilities sited near communities of color

**The Solution: Green Affordable Housing**

**1. Net-Zero New Construction:**
- All new federally-funded housing must meet net-zero energy standard
- Solar-ready roofs (minimum)
- Electric appliances (no new gas hookups)
- High insulation and air sealing
- Energy Star appliances standard
- Cost: ~5% premium, offset by lower operating costs

**2. Deep Energy Retrofits:**
- **Budget:** $10 billion over 10 years for public housing retrofits
- **Scope:** All public housing to Energy Star standard
- **Priority:** Highest energy burden units first
- **Components:**
  - Insulation (walls, attic, foundation)
  - Air sealing
  - Window replacement
  - Heat pump HVAC (replaces gas/oil)
  - Heat pump water heaters
  - Energy Star appliances
  - LED lighting
- **Co-benefits:** Lower utility bills, improved comfort, healthier air

**3. Health Hazard Remediation:**
- **Lead:** 100% of public housing lead-safe by 2030
- **Asbestos:** Abatement in all federally-funded housing
- **Mold:** Remediation and prevention
- **Radon:** Testing and mitigation
- **Pests:** Integrated pest management
- **Budget:** Integrated with capital improvements

**4. Environmental Justice Siting:**
- No new affordable housing within 1 mile of:
  - Superfund sites
  - Major industrial facilities
  - Highway interchanges (air quality)
  - Flood zones (without elevation)
- Prioritize remediation of existing housing in impacted areas
- Community input on siting decisions

**5. Climate Resilience:**
- Flood-resistant construction in vulnerable areas
- Cooling centers and green space for extreme heat
- Backup power for critical facilities
- Resilient design standards

**6. Community Solar:**
- Enable community solar access for renters
- Low-income priority for community solar subscriptions
- Bill credits reduce energy burden
- No rooftop required

**Cross-References:**
- See Chapter 12 (Energy) for building efficiency programs
- See Chapter 13 (EPA) for environmental justice framework
- See Chapter 22 (Treasury) for green energy tax incentives
