# Chapter 10: Department of Agriculture

## Executive Summary

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) governs the food system that sustains 330 million Americans and the agricultural economy that employs tens of millions more. Its mandate reaches from food safety and nutrition assistance to conservation, rural development, trade, research, and the economic viability of the farms and ranches that feed the nation. The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which serves more than 42 million people in any given month; the National School Lunch Program, which feeds approximately 30 million children each school day; the Farm Service Agency (FSA), which provides the financial safety net that keeps family farms solvent; and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which pays farmers to steward the land on which American agriculture depends for the next century.

Project 2025's blueprint for the USDA was explicit and systematic: transfer risk from agribusiness to taxpayers and family farmers, dismantle food safety and nutrition standards, terminate conservation investment, and weaponize crop insurance and commodity programs to accelerate the consolidation of farmland into fewer and fewer mega-operations. The Trump administration executed that blueprint with speed and thoroughness. DOGE-directed mass terminations removed more than 20,000 USDA employees by mid-2025. The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program — a $3 billion investment covering 14,000 farmers and 3.2 million acres — was cancelled on April 14, 2025. SNAP was cut by $186 billion over ten years through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed July 4, 2025, stripping benefits from an estimated 22.3 million families. Conservation Technical Assistance funding was zeroed out in the FY2026 budget proposal. The Food Safety and Inspection Service lost 555 experienced staff, with more than 63 percent of departing employees drawn from the inspections group. The result is a department crippled in capacity, corrupted in purpose, and actively hostile to the family farmers, rural communities, and food-insecure households it was created to serve.

This chapter restores the USDA to its statutory and constitutional purpose. It reverses the damage of Project 2025 and the Trump administration's implementation of that agenda, and it advances a transformative agenda that makes the USDA the institutional engine of food security, environmental stewardship, competitive markets, and rural economic renewal.

**The Stakes**: Approximately 47.9 million Americans lived in food-insecure households in 2024, according to USDA's own data. Eighty-five percent of counties with the highest food insecurity rates are rural. The United States has lost more than 15,000 farms since 2018, with total farmland declining by 2.5 million acres in 2025 alone. Four companies now control 85 percent of the U.S. beef market. The top 10 percent of farms now receive the majority of federal farm program payments. These are not market outcomes — they are the product of deliberate policy choices. They can be reversed by deliberate policy choices in the opposite direction.

**Key Reforms**:
- Restore and permanently protect SNAP benefits; repeal the SNAP provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1, 2025)
- Reinstate strong school meal nutrition standards under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (42 U.S.C. § 1779)
- Relaunch the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program with permanent congressional authorization and expanded funding
- Restore and fully staff the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks
- Restore the USDA workforce and rebuild the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), FSA, NRCS, and Rural Development agencies
- Enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. § 181 et seq.) against monopolistic concentration in beef, pork, and poultry markets
- Cap commodity program payments per operation; redirect support from mega-farms to beginning, small, and mid-size farmers
- Restore and expand the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) under 16 U.S.C. § 3831 and EQIP funding under 16 U.S.C. § 3839aa
- Invest $10 billion over five years in rural broadband, rural hospitals, rural housing, and rural business development
- Establish a USDA Office of Food Systems Equity to address food deserts, food apartheid, and racial disparities in USDA program access

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Article I, Section 8 (Spending Clause, Commerce Clause); Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.); Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. § 2011 et seq.); Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. § 1751 et seq.); Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. § 1501 et seq.); Conservation Reserve Program (16 U.S.C. § 3831 et seq.); Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. § 181 et seq.); Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C. § 713a et seq.); Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002.

## Part I: Project 2025 USDA Damage and Destruction

### Damage Area 1: DOGE Decimation of the USDA Workforce

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 called for eliminating "duplicative" functions, reducing "regulatory overreach," and shrinking the federal workforce on the premise that market mechanisms could replace institutional expertise. **"The next Administration should move quickly to reform the federal workforce to ensure that USDA can carry out its core functions while eliminating the culture of radical progressivism that has infected the department's scientific and policy staff."** *(Project 2025, p. 289)* The Trump administration translated this ideological abstraction into mass terminations beginning February 13, 2025 — the day Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was sworn in.

By mid-2025, USDA had lost more than 20,000 employees — a staggering hollowing-out of institutional capacity that was unparalleled in the department's modern history. DOGE initially listed at least 110 USDA offices across nine agencies for lease cancellations, representing an estimated $59.3 million in contract savings. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) — the internal scientific engine of American agriculture and the largest publicly funded agricultural research system in the world — lost 1,225 employees to DOGE's Deferred Resignation Program and an additional 298 staff through other separations between January and March 2025 alone. The four major USDA research agencies collectively lost approximately 23 percent of their staff in just two months. DOGE proposed closing the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland, which has operated continuously since 1910 and hosts research critical to crop pathology, human nutrition, and animal science.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service lost 555 employees in the same period, with the departing workforce averaging 16 years of service and more than 63 percent classified as members of the investigations group — the front-line inspectors on whom meat, poultry, and egg safety depends. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), which funds land-grant university research, lost staff who coordinated hundreds of millions of dollars in competitive research grants. Rural Development offices — already thinly staffed in the rural counties most dependent on their services — were targeted for closure and consolidated, removing the local presence that allowed farmers and rural residents to access program services in person. FSA county offices, the primary point of contact between the federal government and individual farmers for loan applications, disaster assistance, and commodity program enrollment, were slated for elimination across the country.

Courts partially reversed these terminations. The Merit Systems Protection Board ordered thousands of probationary USDA employees reinstated. But the institutional damage was immediate and lasting: research projects stopped mid-stream, institutional knowledge in the form of decades of accumulated expertise walked out the door, and the administration's reorganization plans continued to threaten further dismemberment of agencies that rural communities and the American food system depend on.

**The Scientific Consequence:** ARS conducts research that private industry will not fund because its benefits are public goods — pest and disease resistance for crops that face no proprietary market, food safety detection methods available to all processors, soil science applicable to every farm regardless of size. The scientists who departed carried with them irreplaceable knowledge of ongoing long-term experiments and research partnerships that cannot simply be resumed by hiring replacements. The Beltsville Agricultural Research Center alone hosts studies spanning decades in soil microbiology, plant genetics, and watershed ecology. Their termination represents a permanent loss to the national agricultural science base.

**The Operational Consequence:** The loss of ARS scientists terminated research projects directly relevant to crop disease resistance, drought tolerance, pest management, and soil health — the scientific foundations on which the long-term resilience of American agriculture depends. These are not programs that can be rebuilt in a fiscal year. The loss of experienced FSIS inspectors compromises the daily legal requirement of federal meat inspection and creates the conditions for preventable foodborne illness outbreaks. Federal meat inspection under 21 U.S.C. § 601 et seq. is a continuous legal requirement; it does not stop when inspectors are fired. It continues with an understaffed, overextended workforce whose capacity to detect contamination, enforce pathogen reduction standards, and respond to emerging food safety threats is systematically degraded.

### Damage Area 2: SNAP — The Largest Cut to Food Assistance in American History

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 called for restructuring SNAP into a block grant, imposing stricter work requirements, and reducing federal matching to states. **"SNAP should be reformed to ensure work requirements are robust and enforced, that able-bodied adults without dependents are required to work, and that the program is restructured to provide appropriate incentives."** *(Project 2025, p. 291)*

The Trump administration executed this agenda through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1), signed July 4, 2025. The bill contains the largest cut to food assistance in American history: $186 billion reduced from SNAP over ten years. An estimated 22.3 million families will lose some or all of their SNAP benefits as a result.

The specific mechanisms of the cuts are punishing and deliberate. The work requirement age threshold for able-bodied adults without dependents was raised from 18-55 to 18-65, capturing seniors and near-seniors whose employment options are limited. Parents of children aged 14 or older are now subject to work requirements — a provision that specifically targets single-parent households. Veterans, individuals experiencing homelessness, and former foster youth — populations previously exempt — are now subject to the new eligibility restrictions. Administrative cost reimbursement to states was cut from 50 percent to 25 percent beginning in FY2027, effectively shifting the cost burden of SNAP administration to states already strained by Medicaid cuts.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins compounded the damage by threatening to cut off federal SNAP funding to Democratic-leaning states that declined to share SNAP program data — an overt use of federal benefit administration as partisan leverage against state governments attempting to protect their residents.

---

### Damage Area 3: Climate-Smart Agriculture Destroyed; Conservation Frozen

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 treated conservation and climate programs as ideologically suspect expenditures: **"Climate-change provisions embedded in agricultural programs have redirected taxpayer dollars away from farmers and toward an ideological agenda."** *(Project 2025, p. 297)*

The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities (PCSC) program represented a $3 billion federal commitment matched by more than $1 billion in private funding, engaging 135 partner organizations, 14,000 enrolled farmers, and 3.2 million acres of working lands in practices that reduced emissions, improved soil health, and built farm resilience. The Trump administration froze PCSC payments immediately upon taking office in late January 2025. On April 14, 2025, after nearly three months of frozen funding that had already disrupted conservation projects across the country, the USDA formally cancelled the program. Grants recipients were given a replacement program — Advancing Markets for Producers (AMP) — stripped of climate language and requiring 65 percent of funds go directly to farmers, without the science, measurement, and verification infrastructure that made PCSC valuable.

Conservation programs under EQIP and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) were funded in part through the Inflation Reduction Act. The Trump administration froze all IRA-related USDA spending at the start of the term. EQIP had been scheduled to receive $8.45 billion from IRA appropriations. Conservation Technical Assistance funding — the NRCS technical staff who work directly with farmers to design conservation systems — was proposed for elimination, falling from $776.5 million in FY2025 to zero in the FY2026 budget proposal. No new CRP enrollments were accepted after the expiration of the prior farm bill extension on September 30, 2024.

---

### Damage Area 4: School Nutrition Standards Undermined; Meatpacking Monopoly Protected

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 targeted the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act's nutrition standards for school meals as executive overreach and called for returning control to states and localities, effectively eliminating federal nutrition floors. The Trump administration's first term saw court-rejected attempts to weaken sodium and whole-grain standards. The second term pursued deregulation through a combination of legislative action and new dietary guidelines that shifted federal nutrition policy toward full-fat dairy and red meat.

The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025, signed January 14, 2026, allows schools to serve whole milk where previous standards required fat-free or reduced-fat milk. New Dietary Guidelines for Americans released in 2025 encouraged consumption of red meat and full-fat dairy and contained the first-ever guidance against "highly processed" foods — a formulation that industry-aligned appointees shaped to ensure it imposed no specific restrictions on ultra-processed products marketed to children.

On antitrust, the damage was more direct. Four companies control 85 percent of the U.S. beef market. The Biden administration had finalized three rounds of regulatory reforms under the Packers and Stockyards Act to establish enforceable definitions of unfair practices and protect contract farmers. The Trump USDA withdrew a proposed rule that would have defined "unfair practices" in livestock and poultry markets and cancelled a partnership with state attorneys general that had supported antitrust enforcement in agricultural markets. The result: meatpackers face no meaningful regulatory constraint on their market power, and the independent livestock producer faces a take-it-or-leave-it price.

---

### Damage Area 5: Rural Development Defunded; Beginning Farmers Abandoned

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Rural Development (RD) is the USDA agency responsible for water and wastewater systems, rural housing, rural business loans, rural broadband, and rural health facilities. It is the institutional backbone of federal investment in the communities that grow America's food. Project 2025 proposed reducing RD to a skeleton operation on the theory that private capital should serve rural communities where it finds profit sufficient. **"USDA Rural Development programs should be subject to rigorous review to eliminate redundant, ineffective, and mission-creeping activities."** *(Project 2025, p. 302)* The unstated corollary: activities that private capital declines to fund because rural markets are insufficiently profitable are deemed "mission-creeping" and eliminated.

DOGE targeted Rural Development offices alongside FSA offices. In many rural counties, the local RD or FSA office is the only meaningful federal presence — the institution through which small farmers access loans, disaster assistance, and conservation contracts, and through which rural communities access grants for water systems, health facilities, and broadband deployment. The administration's budget proposals cut discretionary RD funding while accelerating the consolidation of FSA offices into regional hubs, increasing travel distances for farmers in remote areas. Beginning farmers — those in the first ten years of operating, disproportionately young people, women, and farmers of color attempting to enter a market dominated by established operations — lost access to FSA loan officers and NRCS technical assistance staff who had guided them through applications for loans, operating capital, and conservation cost-shares.

The Farm Service Agency administers the Emergency Loan Program (7 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq.) and the Emergency Conservation Program (16 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq.), which are the primary federal disaster response mechanisms for individual farm operations. Office closures and staff reductions mean that when drought, flood, wildfire, or hurricane strikes a farming community, the institutional capacity to process emergency loan applications and deliver disaster payments is diminished at exactly the moment it is most needed.

The cumulative effect is a federal government that has withdrawn from rural America precisely when rural America faces its most acute crisis: farm consolidation eliminating livelihoods, broadband gaps excluding rural communities from the modern economy, rural hospital closures ending local health access, and food insecurity rates exceeding urban rates despite rural communities' direct participation in food production.

### Damage Area 6: Crop Insurance Concentration and Farm Bill Stalemate

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The federal crop insurance program, administered by the Risk Management Agency (RMA) under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. § 1501 et seq.), provides approximately $10 billion annually in premium subsidies. The structure of those subsidies — uniform percentage subsidies regardless of operation size — concentrates the largest dollar benefits among the largest operations. A mega-farm with $10 million in insured liability receives premium subsidies ten times larger than a family farm with $1 million in insured liability, without any corresponding difference in the percentage of premium subsidy each receives.

Project 2025 proposed expanding crop insurance coverage and premium subsidies while simultaneously removing conservation compliance requirements that condition crop insurance access on basic environmental stewardship. **"Conservation compliance requirements should not be used to coerce farmers into unrelated land management practices as a condition of receiving crop insurance."** *(Project 2025, p. 295)* The practical effect: large operations receive larger premium subsidies with fewer environmental strings attached, and the conservation compliance requirements that prevent farming of highly erodible land are weakened.

The Trump administration allowed the Farm Bill to expire without passage of new five-year legislation, operating on a series of extensions that preserved the basic structure of commodity and nutrition programs without the reforms that family farm advocates, conservation groups, and nutrition advocates had spent years negotiating. The Farm Bill governs commodity programs, crop insurance, conservation, nutrition, rural development, trade, research, and organic agriculture — essentially the entire policy framework of the USDA — and operating without a current Farm Bill produces planning uncertainty that disproportionately harms beginning farmers and smaller operations that cannot absorb multi-year income uncertainty the way that large capitalized operations can.

### The Human Cost

Forty-seven point nine million Americans lived in food-insecure households in 2024, according to USDA's own Economic Research Service data. Eighty-five percent of counties with the highest food insecurity rates are rural — a devastating rebuttal to the assumption that agriculture produces food security for agricultural communities. Nearly 20 percent of children across the country experience food insecurity; in some rural counties, child food insecurity rates reach 50 percent. Nearly 90 percent of U.S. counties suffering long-term "persistent" poverty are entirely rural, linking enduring structural poverty with chronic food insecurity across generations.

The United States has lost 15,000 farms since 2018, with total farmland declining 2.5 million acres in 2025. Not a single U.S. state added farms in 2025. Average farm size climbed to 469 acres in 2025, up from 444 acres in 2018, reflecting a systematic redistribution of agricultural land toward large capitalized operations. Farms generating $500,000 or more in annual sales gained 850,000 acres in 2025 while small and mid-size operations lost ground, market access, and economic viability. This consolidation dynamic is self-reinforcing: as small farms exit, surviving large operations acquire their land, making entry progressively more difficult and expensive for new and beginning farmers.

Four companies control 85 percent of the U.S. beef market. Four sectors of agriculture — seeds, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and animal pharmaceuticals — now meet the definition of an oligopoly, in which four companies control more than 40 percent of the market. About three dozen corporations dictate the development and trade terms for nearly every industry involved in growing, processing, and distributing food.

The SNAP cuts enacted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will remove benefits from 22.3 million families — families that include working adults, children, seniors, veterans, and individuals with disabilities whose employment barriers do not neatly map onto the ideological construct of the "able-bodied adult without dependents." The termination of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities left 14,000 enrolled farmers without the conservation practice payments they had committed acreage to receive, disrupting farm management plans and conservation projects mid-implementation. The loss of 555 experienced FSIS inspectors creates daily risk of preventable contamination in the meat and poultry supply chain that feeds 330 million Americans. The elimination of ARS scientists disrupts decades-long research programs that the global agricultural science community depends on to develop the crop varieties, disease management tools, and soil management practices that American farmers will need to remain productive through accelerating climate change.

---

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

Congress's power to establish and fund the USDA rests on the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) and the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3). Agricultural production and the interstate food supply constitute commerce among the states within the meaning of *Wickard v. Filburn*, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), which upheld federal regulation of agricultural production even for crops consumed on-farm. The Supreme Court's commerce clause jurisprudence, from *Wickard* through *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), confirms broad federal authority over the integrated national food system.

The power to impose conditions on federal nutrition assistance programs — including work requirements, eligibility standards, and benefit levels — rests with Congress under the Spending Clause. The President has no unilateral authority to impose new eligibility conditions on SNAP outside of the statutory framework established by Congress in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008. Executive efforts to impose new conditions by regulation are subject to the major questions doctrine following *West Virginia v. EPA*, 597 U.S. 697 (2022), which requires Congress to clearly authorize agency action of "vast economic and political significance."

The authority of the Executive Branch to rescind congressionally appropriated funds is constrained by the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq.), which prohibits the executive from refusing to obligate appropriated funds except through the formal rescission process requiring congressional approval. Freezing IRA-funded conservation payments constitutes a unilateral impoundment in violation of that statute.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Food and Nutrition Act of 2008** (7 U.S.C. § 2011 et seq.): Establishes SNAP, defines eligibility, sets benefit calculation methodology, and assigns administration to USDA's Food and Nutrition Service. Congress sets the statutory framework; USDA implements by regulation under 7 C.F.R. Part 271 et seq.

**Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act** (42 U.S.C. § 1751 et seq.): Establishes the National School Lunch Program and authorizes USDA to set nutrition standards for participating schools. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-296) strengthened those standards and authorized USDA to set minimum nutrition requirements.

**Federal Crop Insurance Act** (7 U.S.C. § 1501 et seq.): Authorizes the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) and the Risk Management Agency (RMA) to administer the federal crop insurance program, which provides premium subsidies and reinsurance to participating insurance companies.

**Conservation Reserve Program** (16 U.S.C. § 3831 et seq.): Authorizes the CRP, under which USDA enters into annual rental agreements with farmers who agree to remove environmentally sensitive land from production and establish conservation cover.

**Environmental Quality Incentives Program** (16 U.S.C. § 3839aa et seq.): Authorizes EQIP, which provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural and forestry operations to implement conservation practices.

**Packers and Stockyards Act** (7 U.S.C. § 181 et seq.): Prohibits unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practices and undue preferences by packers, swine contractors, and live poultry dealers. Administered by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Packers and Stockyards Division.

**Agricultural Adjustment Act** (7 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.): Establishes the framework for commodity price support programs and the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which finances farm program payments.

### Agricultural Administrative Law

USDA rulemaking is subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq.), requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking for substantive rules. The abrupt termination of Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities grant agreements, without notice-and-comment rulemaking reversing the underlying program authority, raises procedural APA claims. The withdrawal of the Packers and Stockyards unfair practices rulemaking is procedurally permissible but substantively abandons the agency's duty to enforce the statute against documented anticompetitive conduct. The APA arbitrary-and-capricious standard (*Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.*, 463 U.S. 29 (1983)) requires agencies to provide reasoned explanations for policy changes; the Trump administration's reversal of climate-smart agriculture programs, conservation payment freezes, and antitrust enforcement withdrawals are vulnerable to APA challenge where they lack adequate reasoned justification.

Executive Order 12,866 (as amended) requires cost-benefit analysis of significant regulatory actions. The Trump administration's SNAP work requirement expansion, school nutrition standard rollbacks, and conservation funding freezes were not accompanied by the rigorous economic analysis that their projected harm to tens of millions of beneficiaries demands. The SNAP cuts alone — $186 billion over ten years stripped from 22.3 million families — represent economic impacts of an order of magnitude that would ordinarily require a comprehensive Regulatory Impact Analysis examining downstream economic effects on retail food markets, local economies, health care costs, and child development outcomes.

### Farm Bill Authority and Congressional Prerogatives

The Farm Bill, which historically reauthorizes at five-year intervals, provides the statutory framework for virtually all USDA program categories. When the Farm Bill lapses — as it did repeatedly during the Trump administration period — USDA operates on extension authority that freezes program terms at prior-law levels. The consequence for conservation programs is particularly severe: without new Farm Bill reauthorization, USDA cannot implement conservation program improvements, adjust payment rates to reflect current costs, or enroll new acreage under new terms. This creates a structural incentive for congressional obstruction — blocking Farm Bill reauthorization has the practical effect of preventing conservation program modernization and nutrition standard updates without requiring any affirmative vote to repeal those programs.

Congress retains the authority to direct USDA appropriations through the annual appropriations process, to expand or restrict program eligibility through the Farm Bill and standalone legislation, and to conduct oversight of USDA program administration through the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. This chapter's legislative proposals are designed to be enacted through the Farm Bill reauthorization process where possible, consolidated in a comprehensive Farm Bill that establishes durable statutory baselines that cannot be reversed by executive action alone.

## Part III: Comprehensive USDA Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: Protect and Expand Food and Nutrition Assistance

The SNAP provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act represent the most destructive federal anti-hunger legislation in American history. Repeal is not merely a policy preference — it is a moral and constitutional obligation. Congress enacted SNAP under its Spending Clause authority to promote the general welfare. Stripping nutrition assistance from veterans, seniors, parents, and homeless individuals defeats that purpose.

**Immediate Executive Actions:**

Issue an Executive Order directing USDA's Food and Nutrition Service to implement the repealed SNAP provisions in the manner most protective of beneficiaries consistent with existing law, and to exercise all available administrative discretion to maximize access, including expanding categorical eligibility, suspending the broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE) rollbacks pursued by the prior administration, and restoring the standard utility allowance methodology.

Direct FNS to reinstate the full 50 percent federal match for state SNAP administrative costs, pending legislative restoration, to prevent states from reducing program access due to administrative funding shortfalls.

Restore the SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot to all 50 states, enabling food-insecure households to use SNAP benefits for online grocery delivery — a program especially critical for rural recipients in food deserts.

**Legislative Requirements:**

Introduce the Food Security Act of 2027, which permanently codifies the following: maximum gross income threshold at 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level; elimination of categorical work requirements that do not distinguish between voluntary unemployment and structural barriers to employment; restoration of the 50 percent federal administrative match; and automatic benefit adjustment tied to the USDA's Thrifty Food Plan update cycle, ensuring benefit adequacy reflects actual food cost inflation.

Under 7 U.S.C. § 2014, expand categorical eligibility to all households receiving any means-tested federal benefit, eliminating cliff effects that create perverse incentives against income increases.

**School Nutrition Standards:**

Issue an Executive Order directing USDA to reissue the 2022 school meal nutrition standards under 42 U.S.C. § 1779 as interim final rules with immediate effect, restoring sodium reduction targets, whole-grain requirements, and added sugar limits. Direct FNS to initiate notice-and-comment rulemaking to establish science-based standards aligned with current Dietary Guidelines while resisting food industry capture of the dietary guideline process.

---

### Reform II: Rebuild the USDA Workforce and Research Capacity

**Immediate Staffing Restoration:**

Issue an Executive Order directing USDA to offer reinstatement to all employees separated through DOGE's Deferred Resignation Program, Reduction in Force actions, and mass terminations between January 20, 2025, and the date of this administration's inauguration. Reinstatement offers shall include back pay, full restoration of seniority and benefits, and priority placement.

Establish a USDA Workforce Recovery Plan within 60 days of inauguration, identifying critical staffing gaps in ARS, FSIS, FSA, NRCS, and Rural Development, and developing a five-year hiring and retention plan with funding requests for the FY2028 budget cycle.

**Agricultural Research Service:**

Direct ARS to reopen the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center and to reinstate all research projects terminated as a result of the 2025 DOGE-directed staffing reductions. Commission a National Academy of Sciences review of critical ARS research gaps created by the 2025 terminations and develop a research restoration plan for submission to Congress.

Increase ARS base appropriations by $500 million annually over five years, prioritizing: climate adaptation for major commodity crops; soil health and regenerative agriculture science; pest and disease resistance; food safety detection technology; and nutrition science to support evidence-based dietary guidance free from industry influence.

**Food Safety and Inspection Service:**

FSIS is legally mandated under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. § 451 et seq.) to conduct continuous inspection in federally inspected establishments. The loss of 555 inspectors, 63 percent of whom were drawn from the investigations group, is an acute public health threat.

Direct FSIS to execute an emergency hiring and training initiative to restore the inspections group to pre-2025 staffing levels within 18 months. Increase FSIS appropriations by $200 million annually to support hiring, retention, and technology modernization. Establish an annual public FSIS workforce report to Congress tracking inspector staffing levels, vacancy rates, and inspection throughput by district.

---

### Reform III: Climate-Smart Agriculture and Conservation

**Relaunch Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities:**

Issue an Executive Order reinstating the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program under CCC Charter Act authority (15 U.S.C. § 713a) with immediate effect, directing USDA to honor existing grant agreements for all expenses incurred after January 20, 2025, and to reopen the program to new applications.

Establish the Climate-Smart Agriculture Fund — a permanent, mandatory spending vehicle appropriating $1 billion annually for at least ten years — to replace the prior program's reliance on discretionary IRA transfers that proved vulnerable to executive impoundment.

**Conservation Reserve Program:**

Direct FSA to immediately reopen CRP enrollment under 16 U.S.C. § 3831, prioritizing highly erodible land, riparian buffers, wetland restoration, and grassland protection in the Great Plains, Midwest, and Southeast. Increase the CRP acreage cap from the current 27 million acres to 35 million acres through legislation, recognizing that demand for CRP enrollment consistently exceeds available slots.

**EQIP and Conservation Technical Assistance:**

Restore NRCS Conservation Technical Assistance funding to $1 billion annually — significantly above pre-2025 levels — recognizing that technical assistance capacity is the binding constraint on farmer adoption of conservation practices. The technical staff who work with individual farmers on conservation system design cannot be replaced by grant dollars alone.

Direct NRCS to prioritize EQIP funding toward practices with the highest measured environmental benefit per dollar, using the Environmental Benefits Index (EBI) system with updated climate weights that incorporate soil carbon sequestration, methane reduction, and nitrous oxide abatement alongside the existing water quality, soil erosion, and wildlife habitat criteria.

**Waters of the United States:**

Reinstate a protective WOTUS definition under the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) in coordination with EPA, consistent with *Sackett v. EPA*, 598 U.S. 651 (2023), to the maximum extent that Supreme Court precedent permits. Agricultural exemptions under 33 U.S.C. § 1344(f) remain intact; the goal is to protect the wetlands, streams, and water bodies that farming communities depend on for irrigation, aquifer recharge, and flood attenuation.

---

### Reform IV: Antitrust and Fair Markets

**Packers and Stockyards Act Enforcement:**

The Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. § 181 et seq.) has been law since 1921. Four companies now control 85 percent of the U.S. beef market. This is not a competitive market; it is a structural failure that depresses prices for independent cattle producers and raises prices for consumers. The USDA has both the statutory authority and the affirmative duty to act.

Issue an Executive Order directing AMS's Packers and Stockyards Division to: (1) complete and finalize the unfair practices rulemaking withdrawn by the Trump administration; (2) establish a Livestock and Poultry Market Integrity Unit within AMS with dedicated investigative and prosecutorial resources; (3) require packer reporting of transaction prices and volume data sufficient to establish whether market manipulation is occurring; and (4) coordinate with DOJ Antitrust Division on structural remedies, including potential divestiture proceedings against packing companies that have achieved market concentration incompatible with competitive markets.

Reinstate the Inclusive Competition and Market Integrity rules finalized under the Biden administration in January 2025, covering undue preferences, deceptive practices, and tournament system abuses in poultry contracting.

**Commodity Program Payment Caps:**

Under the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. § 1308 et seq.), payment limits already exist but are riddled with loopholes that allow large operations to structure around them. Issue an Executive Order directing USDA to close payment limit loopholes through regulation and request legislation establishing an absolute annual payment cap of $125,000 per farm operation across all commodity program benefits, including ARC, PLC, and marketing loan benefits. Redirect payment savings toward beginning farmer loan programs, conservation cost-shares for small and mid-size operations, and direct support for farmers of color closing the access gap in USDA program participation.

**Beginning Farmer and Rancher Support:**

The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program (BFRDP) and the FSA Beginning Farmer direct and guaranteed loan programs (7 C.F.R. Part 764) are the primary federal mechanisms supporting new entrants into agriculture. Increase BFRDP funding from approximately $20 million to $75 million annually. Direct FSA to eliminate loan application backlog and reduce average loan processing time to 60 days. Establish a USDA Farmland Access Program to connect retiring farmers with beginning farmer successors, combating the consolidation dynamic that turns farm retirements into acreage absorbed by mega-operations.

### Reform V: Rural Development, Economic Equity, and Food System Resilience

**Rural Broadband:**

Approximately 25 percent of rural Americans lack access to broadband at speeds adequate for modern work, education, and health care. This is not a minor inconvenience — it is a structural exclusion from the twenty-first century economy that compounds every other disadvantage facing rural communities. Remote work opportunities, telehealth, online education, precision agriculture technology, and direct-to-consumer marketing all require reliable high-speed internet access. Rural communities locked out of broadband are locked out of economic recovery.

The USDA's ReConnect Program provides grants and loans for rural broadband deployment under 7 C.F.R. Part 1740. Double the ReConnect Program appropriation to $1 billion annually. Require build-out timelines with clawback provisions for non-performance, ensuring that grant recipients who fail to build the promised infrastructure return the funds rather than holding grants open indefinitely. Mandate open access requirements preventing ISP monopoly on rural broadband infrastructure funded with federal dollars — infrastructure built with public money should be available to multiple service providers on non-discriminatory terms.

Coordinate with FCC's E-Rate Program and Treasury's State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund to ensure rural broadband investments do not create redundant or incompatible infrastructure across federal programs. Establish a USDA-FCC Rural Connectivity Task Force to produce a single national rural broadband coverage map updated annually and used to target remaining investment gaps.

**Rural Health Infrastructure:**

Rural hospital closures have accelerated dramatically in the past decade. More than 140 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, with dozens more at risk of closure due to financial insolvency. Rural communities that lose their hospital lose not merely a health care facility — they lose the largest employer in many small towns, the only source of emergency care, and a critical economic anchor for the surrounding community.

USDA's Community Facilities Program (7 C.F.R. Part 3570) provides loans and grants for health care facilities, schools, and community buildings in rural areas. Increase Community Facilities Program funding to $500 million annually with priority for health care facility construction and renovation. Establish a Rural Hospital Stabilization Grant Program within USDA Rural Development providing transition funding for rural hospitals at risk of closure, conditioned on adoption of sustainable operating models including regional cooperative arrangements, telehealth integration, and rural health clinic conversion where full hospital services cannot be sustained.

**Rural Water and Wastewater Infrastructure:**

Approximately 2 million rural Americans lack access to safe drinking water or adequate wastewater treatment. The inadequacy is concentrated in tribal lands, colonias along the U.S.-Mexico border, and communities of color in rural Appalachia and the rural Southeast. The Water and Environmental Program (7 C.F.R. Part 1780) provides the primary federal financing for rural water and wastewater infrastructure. Increase WEP funding to $1.5 billion annually, with 30 percent reserved for tribal nations and communities with median household incomes below 60 percent of the state median. Establish a rural water infrastructure safety standard requiring states to inventory rural drinking water systems and prioritize systems with lead pipe exposure, bacterial contamination, or nitrate levels exceeding EPA's maximum contaminant levels.

**Historically Underserved Farmers:**

The documented history of USDA discrimination against Black, Native American, Latino, and Asian American farmers is not a matter of historical dispute. It is the record of decades of court proceedings, agency investigations, and congressional findings. *Pigford v. Glickman*, 185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C. 1999), and the subsequent *Pigford II* settlement established the legal record: USDA systematically denied Black farmers equal access to FSA loans, disaster payments, and commodity programs for decades. The cumulative wealth loss from this discrimination is estimated in the billions of dollars — wealth that would have been passed to subsequent generations had USDA treated Black farmers fairly.

The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act included $4 billion in debt relief for socially disadvantaged farmers under Section 1005, which was challenged and substantially blocked by courts applying a race-neutrality analysis. The underlying statutory authority — Section 2501 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. § 2279) — and the demonstrable history of USDA discrimination provide the foundation for remediation programs designed to comply with current equal protection doctrine, including race-neutral programs targeting documented economic harms regardless of recipient race and race-conscious programs narrowly tailored to remedy the specific documented discrimination.

Establish a USDA Office of Civil Rights Remediation with statutory authority, subpoena power, and an independent reporting line to the Secretary, with the mandate to: review all USDA program access data by race, gender, and socioeconomic status; identify disparities attributable to program design or administrative practice; develop race-neutral and race-conscious remedies appropriate to the specific harm; and refer civil rights violations to the DOJ Civil Rights Division.

**Food Deserts and Urban Agriculture:**

Seventeen percent of the contiguous United States, home to approximately 39 million Americans, qualifies as a low-income, low-access food desert under USDA's Food Access Research Atlas. These are communities where the nearest grocery store is more than one mile away for urban residents or more than ten miles away for rural residents, and where a significant share of households lack access to a vehicle.

Establish a Food Systems Equity Grant Program within USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service to fund community food cooperatives, urban and peri-urban farms, mobile food markets, food hub infrastructure, and grocery store development in food deserts. Appropriate $250 million annually for five years, with 50 percent reserved for communities with median household incomes below 80 percent of area median. Establish a SNAP Market Incentive Program providing matching funds for SNAP purchases at farmers markets, mobile food vendors, and community-supported agriculture programs, building on the existing Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) under 7 U.S.C. § 7517.

---

### Reform VI: Organic Agriculture and Food System Integrity

**National Organic Program:**

The National Organic Program (NOP) under 7 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq. and 7 C.F.R. Part 205 establishes the standards, certification, and enforcement framework for organic agriculture. Organic food now represents a $60 billion-plus market in the United States, with a producer price premium that provides a meaningful pathway to economic viability for small and mid-size farms. The integrity of the organic label — and the farmer premium that depends on it — requires rigorous enforcement against fraudulent organic claims, particularly for imported commodities labeled as organic that may have been produced with prohibited inputs.

The Trump administration weakened enforcement by reducing NOP compliance staff and delaying the Strengthening Organic Enforcement (SOE) Rule, which had been finalized to require accredited certifier oversight of more supply chain actors and to establish import certification requirements that would have made organic fraud more difficult.

Direct USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service to fully implement and enforce the SOE Rule (effective March 20, 2024) with no further delay, including the import certification requirements that prevent fraudulent organic labeling of conventionally produced imports. Increase NOP compliance staff by 30 percent and establish an organic fraud hotline with credible whistleblower protections for certifiers and farmers who report violations. Direct AMS to establish a risk-based inspection protocol that prioritizes unannounced inspections of operations with prior compliance issues and of imported organic commodities from origin countries with limited oversight capacity.

Require annual public reporting of NOP compliance actions, including the number of violations detected, certificates suspended, and civil penalties assessed. The organic label's value to producers depends on public confidence that the label is enforced — transparency in enforcement is not optional.

**Seed Diversity and Intellectual Property:**

The concentration of the seed industry is among the least visible but most consequential structural problems in American agriculture. Four companies — following the mergers of Bayer-Monsanto, Dow-DuPont (Corteva), ChemChina-Syngenta, and BASF — now control over 50 percent of the global commercial seed market. This concentration gives seed companies pricing power that farmers cannot resist, because the choice of whether to pay the premium for commercially developed seed varieties or accept lower yields from publicly developed alternatives is, for many crops, not a meaningful choice.

The concentration also threatens agricultural biodiversity. When a handful of companies control seed development, their breeding priorities reflect their commercial interests — maximum yield in industrial production systems for crops grown on the largest farms. Crops that are more resilient, more nutritious, better adapted to specific regional conditions, or more suitable for diversified farming systems receive less investment because the commercial return is smaller.

Direct USDA's Agricultural Research Service to expand the National Plant Germplasm System, the federal repository of seed diversity that serves as the insurance policy for American agricultural genetics. Increase NIFA funding for public plant breeding programs at land-grant universities. Establish a USDA Seed Access Program that provides beginning and small-scale farmers with access to publicly developed, non-patented seed varieties at prices reflecting actual production cost rather than corporate profit margins. Coordinate with DOJ Antitrust Division to conduct comprehensive review of seed industry concentration and develop a framework for merger review in seed and agricultural input markets that accounts for the unique structural harms that concentration creates in agricultural markets.

**Supply Chain Resilience:**

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of a food supply chain that had been optimized for efficiency and concentrated in a small number of very large processing facilities. When four meatpacking plants closed or reduced operations in spring 2020, grocery store shelves emptied and farmers euthanized animals they could not get to market. The supply chain crisis was a direct consequence of the consolidation dynamic that Project 2025 sought to accelerate.

Establish a USDA Office of Supply Chain Resilience within the Agricultural Marketing Service, charged with: conducting annual assessments of concentration risk in food processing and distribution; developing contingency plans for supply chain disruptions; providing technical and financial assistance to regional food processing facilities that provide redundancy to the concentrated national supply chain; and working with FSIS to streamline inspection requirements for small and mid-size processing facilities that serve regional markets.

Invest in regional food hubs — facilities that aggregate, store, process, and distribute food from multiple producers to institutional buyers such as schools, hospitals, and military installations — through USDA's Local and Regional Food System grants and the Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (7 U.S.C. § 1627c). Appropriate $300 million annually for regional food hub development and operation, recognizing that supply chain resilience requires not just processing capacity but the logistics infrastructure to connect distributed production with institutional demand.

### Reform VII: Agricultural Labor Standards and Worker Protections

**H-2A and Domestic Farm Worker Protections:**

Approximately one million farm workers are employed under the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a)), which ties workers to specific employers and creates inherent structural vulnerability to wage theft, housing violations, and retaliation. The USDA's role in H-2A is coordination with DOL on housing and transportation standards for H-2A workers — standards that are routinely violated and inadequately enforced.

The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.) provides the primary federal protection framework for domestic migrant and seasonal farm workers. Enforcement responsibility lies with DOL's Wage and Hour Division, but USDA has a direct role through its authority to condition program participation on compliance with applicable labor law. An employer receiving FSA loans, crop insurance premium subsidies, or USDA program payments who violates minimum wage law, housing standards, or anti-retaliation provisions is receiving federal subsidy while committing federal labor violations. USDA has both the authority and the obligation to address this.

Establish a joint USDA-DOL Agricultural Worker Protection Initiative that: (1) expands USDA housing inspections to cover all H-2A labor camps with an annual inspection cycle, with results published in a publicly accessible database; (2) creates a USDA Office of Agricultural Labor Compliance with authority to condition USDA loan and program access on employer compliance with H-2A wage, housing, and transportation standards and with the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act; (3) funds USDA cooperative extension outreach to farm workers on legal rights in English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and other languages spoken by the agricultural workforce; and (4) prohibits USDA program participation for a period of five years by employers with documented wage theft or labor trafficking violations.

**Cooperative Extension and Agricultural Education:**

The Cooperative Extension System, established by the Smith-Lever Act (7 U.S.C. § 341 et seq.), delivers USDA research and education to farmers and rural communities through land-grant universities in every state. Extension agents are often the primary conduit through which individual farmers learn about new pest management strategies, conservation practices, market opportunities, and program eligibility. The DOGE-directed staffing reductions at NIFA disrupted extension program funding and coordination.

Restore NIFA appropriations to pre-2025 levels and increase the Extension Activities line by 20 percent. Direct NIFA to prioritize extension programs serving beginning farmers, farmers of color, and farmers transitioning to organic or climate-smart practices who have historically been underserved by extension systems designed around the needs of large conventional commodity operations.

**Farm Worker Housing:**

Approximately 500,000 farm workers lack adequate housing, according to pre-2025 USDA data, including an estimated 200,000 who are homeless during some portion of the agricultural season. The USDA's Farm Labor Housing program (7 U.S.C. § 1484 et seq.) provides direct loans and grants for construction and repair of farm worker housing. Increase Farm Labor Housing program funding from approximately $30 million annually to $150 million annually, prioritizing construction of permanent affordable housing in agricultural regions with documented housing shortages and targeting employers whose H-2A workers are currently housed in non-compliant conditions.

## Conclusion

The Department of Agriculture is not a marginal agency. It governs the most fundamental material reality of American life: what people eat, whether children go to school fed, whether family farms survive another generation, whether rural communities have the infrastructure and economic opportunities to remain viable, and whether the land that American agriculture depends on is stewarded for the next century or depleted in the service of the next quarterly earnings report.

Project 2025 understood the USDA's centrality and targeted it accordingly — with workforce destruction, nutrition assistance cuts of historic scale, conservation program termination, antitrust enforcement withdrawal, and regulatory capture in service of agribusiness concentration. The damage inflicted between January 2025 and this administration's inauguration is severe, measurable, and in some respects lasting. Research that was stopped cannot be fully recovered. Institutional knowledge that walked out the door with experienced employees cannot be entirely replaced. Farms that consolidated during a period of regulatory neglect do not automatically reconstitute when enforcement resumes.

But the policy framework for a transformed USDA is not only restorative in character. It is transformative. An agriculture department that enforces competition law in livestock markets, that pays farmers for environmental stewardship as a matter of legal obligation rather than discretionary budget priority, that treats food security as a constitutional commitment rather than a welfare program to be means-tested and restricted, and that builds rural America's broadband, health care, and water infrastructure as the foundation of a twenty-first century economy — that department does not merely reverse the damage of Project 2025. It builds the institutional architecture for a food system worthy of the richest agricultural nation in the history of the world.
