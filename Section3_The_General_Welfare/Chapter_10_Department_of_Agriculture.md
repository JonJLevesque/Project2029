## Executive Summary

Project 2025 prioritized large agribusiness over family farmers, rolled back environmental protections, and weakened food safety. This chapter focuses on sustainability and food security, supporting small farmers, promoting climate-smart agriculture, and reversing deregulation that harmed environmental and labor standards.

## The Project 2025 Damage Assessment
- Small farmer support programs cut
- Environmental regulations weakened (CAFOs, pesticides)
- Food safety enforcement reduced
- Agricultural worker protections eliminated
- Climate programs defunded
- Monopoly consolidation accelerated

## Democratic Renewal Agenda

### Small Farmer Support
- Increased funding for beginning farmers
- Crop insurance reform
- Fair market access
- Cooperative development
- Rural broadband investment
- Debt relief programs

### Sustainability and Climate

### Labor Standards
- Agricultural worker protections
- H-2A visa program reform

### Antitrust Enforcement

## Success Metrics

## Conclusion
Agriculture policy must serve family farmers, protect the environment, ensure food security, and treat agricultural workers with dignity.
