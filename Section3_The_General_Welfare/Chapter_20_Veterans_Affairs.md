# Chapter 20: Department of Veterans Affairs

## Executive Summary

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, serving approximately 9 million enrolled veterans through 170 VA Medical Centers, more than 1,200 outpatient clinics, and a sprawling benefits administration that processes millions of disability, education, and home loan claims annually. The VA employs roughly 480,000 workers — more than a quarter of whom are veterans themselves — and operates on a budget exceeding $300 billion annually when mandatory spending on benefits is included. It is not a government bureaucracy in the abstract; it is the concrete, day-to-day promise the nation makes to those who served under arms.

Project 2025 and the Trump administration that implemented its blueprint treated this promise as a cost center to be eliminated. Through a coordinated assault combining mass workforce terminations under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the accelerated privatization of VA healthcare through the MISSION Act's community care provisions, the sustained failure of a $37 billion electronic health records modernization program, and the gutting of mental health, homelessness, and benefits claims infrastructure, the administration engineered the most severe degradation of veterans' services in the VA's 95-year history. In fiscal year 2025, the VA experienced a net loss of more than 40,000 employees — the first such net loss in the department's history. Plans leaked in early 2025 called for terminating up to 83,000 additional employees, reducing the workforce to 2019 staffing levels of approximately 400,000 — levels established before the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 dramatically expanded the VA's obligations to toxic-exposed veterans.

The next Democratic administration will not merely restore the VA. It will transform it into the model of what government-administered healthcare can accomplish: integrated, comprehensive, veteran-centered care that reaches every veteran from rural Montana to urban Detroit, from a 22-year-old Marine struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder to a 90-year-old World War II survivor navigating end-of-life services. The VA's public mission, its integrated model, and its proven capacity for innovation in mental health, telehealth, and preventive care make it indispensable. This chapter is the blueprint for its restoration and transformation.

**The Stakes**: Approximately 17.5 veterans die by suicide every day — a rate more than double that of non-veteran adults. More than 32,000 veterans experience homelessness on any given night. Hundreds of thousands of toxic-exposed veterans are entitled to PACT Act benefits that an eviscerated claims processing workforce cannot deliver. The workforce cuts, privatization push, and technology failures engineered under Project 2025 will translate directly into preventable deaths, uncompensated injuries, and broken promises to the men and women who served.

**Key Reforms**:
- Halt all VA privatization initiatives and reverse MISSION Act community care overexpansion that diverts funding from VA clinical capacity
- Reinstate all unlawfully terminated VA employees and hire to meet PACT Act staffing obligations
- Terminate the Oracle-Cerner Electronic Health Record contract and transition to an open-source, VA-controlled system
- Implement the PACT Act fully, eliminating claims backlogs for toxic-exposed veterans within 24 months
- End veteran homelessness by 2030 through a fully funded Housing First initiative and robust HUD-VASH expansion
- Achieve zero-delay access to VA mental health services for all enrolled veterans within 18 months
- Establish dedicated women veteran centers at every VA medical facility and fully fund Military Sexual Trauma survivor services
- Expand rural veteran telehealth access by eliminating connectivity barriers and funding VA-operated mobile health units
- Protect the GI Bill and Post-9/11 education benefits against predatory institutions and administrative erosion
- Establish a VA Inspector General rapid-response unit with independent prosecutorial referral authority to address fraud, waste, and political interference

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: 38 U.S.C. (Veterans' Benefits Act); 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act); the MISSION Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-182); the PACT Act of 2022 (Pub. L. 117-168); the Veterans Health Care Act (38 U.S.C. §§ 1701-1774); the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. § 3901 et seq.); the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act (38 U.S.C. §§ 3301-3325); the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act; the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.); and Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution granting Congress plenary authority over veterans' benefits.

## Part I: Project 2025 VA Damage and Destruction

### Damage Area 1: The DOGE Mass Termination of the VA Workforce

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025's Chapter 20 called for replacing career civil servants with political appointees, rescinding all delegations of authority granted by prior administrations, and identifying and removing Senior Executive Service employees who did not align with the administration's ideological agenda. It called explicitly for the VA to be "run by more political appointees" to ensure what it termed "political control of the VA." *(Project 2025, Chapter 20)*

The Trump administration translated this blueprint into action through DOGE. In the first weeks of 2025, DOGE teams embedded within the VA began terminating probationary employees across all VA components. By March 2025, DOGE had fired approximately 2,400 VA staffers in the initial wave, with internal VA memoranda — leaked to the press — describing plans to terminate up to 83,000 additional employees and return the department to 2019 staffing levels of approximately 399,957 workers.

The implementation was indiscriminate. At the Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, 18 VA workers with exemplary performance reviews received identical termination emails stating their work was not "in the public interest" — a formulaic rationale that made no reference to actual performance. The fired workforce included approximately 3,000 registered nurses, 1,000 physicians, 1,100 custodians, 700 social workers, and nearly 2,000 claims processors. By the end of fiscal year 2025, the VA had experienced a net loss of more than 40,000 employees — the first net workforce contraction in the department's history.

The ideological targeting was explicit. VA employees who had implemented Biden-era diversity, equity, and inclusion programs were terminated. Veterans Service Organization liaisons embedded within VA components were removed. Employees who had led PACT Act implementation — the very people hired to address the surge in toxic-exposure claims — were terminated as part of a purge that eliminated the infrastructure needed to deliver the law's promised benefits.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand called the plan "an attack on our veterans," noting that veterans themselves — who compose more than a quarter of the VA workforce — were being fired by an administration that claimed to champion them.

**The Consequences of Workforce Destruction:**

The mass terminations created immediate service disruptions. VA medical centers reported inability to schedule new patients for primary care or mental health appointments. Rural clinics lost their sole physicians or nurse practitioners, eliminating care access for geographic areas with no private-sector alternative. Claims processing capacity collapsed: the nearly 2,000 fired claims processors had been central to addressing the backlog created by the PACT Act's historic expansion of presumptive conditions. Veterans who survived burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan, who developed cancers, respiratory diseases, and neurological conditions, were left waiting for benefits owed to them by law.

---

### Damage Area 2: The Privatization of VA Healthcare Through MISSION Act Abuse

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 identified the MISSION Act of 2018's community care provisions as the primary vehicle for dismantling the VA's integrated healthcare system. The document called for codifying MISSION Act access standards in statute to "prevent the VA from avoiding or watering down the requirements in the future," and instructed VA leadership to identify VHA medical centers not generating sufficient referrals to the private sector and compel them to increase outsourcing. *(Project 2025, Chapter 20)*

The Trump administration's FY2026 budget proposal advanced this privatization agenda directly: it proposed a $14.4 billion increase in community care funding — a 67 percent increase from the prior year — while the VA's internal clinical infrastructure received no comparable expansion. Under this model, nearly 75 percent of all new medical care funding was directed not to the VA system but to outside private providers through TriWest Healthcare Alliance and Optum Serve.

**The Structural Harm of VA Privatization:**

The VA's integrated model — in which clinicians, specialists, mental health providers, and social workers share electronic records and coordinate care within a single system — produces demonstrably better outcomes for complex veteran needs, particularly for traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, spinal cord injury, and polytrauma. Studies consistently show that VA care outperforms community care in quality metrics for these conditions.

Diverting veterans to community providers who lack VA-specific clinical expertise, who do not have access to the veteran's integrated medical history, and who operate on fee-for-service incentive structures that do not reward preventive or coordinated care degrades outcomes. It also accelerates a death spiral: as VA referrals decline, VA facilities lose the patient volume necessary to maintain clinical training programs, specialized units, and the economies of scale that make VA care cost-effective. Reduced patient volume justifies further facility closures. Facility closures accelerate privatization. The cycle ends with the elimination of the VA as a functioning integrated healthcare system — which is precisely the outcome Project 2025 sought.

---

### Damage Area 3: The Oracle-Cerner Electronic Health Records Catastrophe

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The VA's Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) project — a contract awarded to Cerner (later acquired by Oracle) in 2018 at an initial cost of $10 billion — had already failed catastrophically before the Trump administration took office. The system had been plagued by patient safety incidents, misplaced laboratory results, incorrect dosage calculations, and technical failures documented at every deployment site. The projected cost had ballooned from the initial $10 billion to approximately $37 billion. During its operational pause, the VA was paying Oracle-Cerner an average of $100 million per month.

The system was also inaccessible to veterans with disabilities, in violation of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794d). VA informed the Office of Management and Budget that achieving 508 compliance would require five to seven additional years.

Rather than terminating a failed contract, the Trump administration maintained it. The DOGE workforce cuts then compounded the disaster by eliminating the IT staff and clinical informatics personnel who had developed the institutional knowledge needed to manage the legacy VistA system as a parallel operation and to evaluate alternatives. By 2025, lawmakers were openly questioning both the cost and the deployment timeline, with the VA announcing yet another restart targeting four Michigan sites in mid-2026.

**The Clinical Consequences:**

The EHRM failure is not an IT procurement failure in the abstract. VA clinicians operating on a degraded, non-integrated electronic health record system make medication errors, miss critical diagnoses, and cannot coordinate care across VA facilities and community providers. Veterans with complex multi-system injuries — the signature wounds of Iraq and Afghanistan — require precisely the kind of seamless, integrated record-keeping that VistA provided and that Oracle-Cerner has failed to replicate. The combination of workforce cuts eliminating clinical informatics staff and the continued deployment of an unsafe, inaccessible records system creates direct patient safety risks.

---

### Damage Area 4: The Assault on Mental Health Services and Suicide Prevention

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 made no affirmative commitment to expanding VA mental health services. Its privatization framework would divert mental health care to community providers without the VA's specialized trauma expertise, its suicide prevention infrastructure, or its coordinated care model. The DOGE workforce cuts eliminated social workers, mental health counselors, and suicide prevention coordinators — the frontline workforce of veteran mental health care.

By early 2025, the Veterans Crisis Line — which had recorded more than 1.3 million contacts in fiscal year 2025, with calls, texts, and chats averaging a response in under ten seconds — faced staffing uncertainty as DOGE cuts reached crisis line operations. The American Prospect documented in February 2026 that VA Secretary Doug Collins had been factually incorrect in his claims about suicide prevention funding, as actual program allocations had been cut contrary to his public assurances.

**The Statistics Behind the Crisis:**

In 2023, 6,398 veterans died by suicide — approximately 17.5 per day. The veteran suicide rate of 35.2 per 100,000 is more than double the rate for non-veteran adults (16.9 per 100,000). Veterans experiencing homelessness have a suicide rate 146 percent higher than housed veterans. Veterans with a recent traumatic brain injury diagnosis have a 94.3 percent higher suicide rate than veterans without TBI. Firearms are involved in 73.3 percent of veteran suicides. Every additional contact with a VA suicide prevention coordinator is associated with a 4 to 5 percent reduction in the odds of a suicide attempt in the following year. Eliminating those coordinators is not an abstraction — it is a quantifiable, preventable increase in deaths.

---

### Damage Area 5: The Undermining of PACT Act Implementation

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The PACT Act of 2022 was the most significant expansion of veterans' benefits in decades, establishing presumptive service connection for approximately 3.5 million veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, radiation, and other toxic substances. It required the VA to dramatically expand its claims processing capacity, its clinical screening infrastructure, and its provider network to meet the surge in newly eligible veterans.

The Trump administration eliminated the staffing hired to implement these obligations. The approximately 2,000 claims processors fired in the DOGE purge had been central to PACT Act delivery. The administrative directives that established PACT Act screening protocols were subjected to ideological review. The budget proposed for FY2026 did not include funding commensurate with the full scope of PACT Act obligations.

The result: veterans with service-connected cancers, respiratory diseases, and neurological conditions — veterans who survived burn pits in Fallujah and Bagram and Baghdad — waited months and years for benefits to which they are legally entitled under an act of Congress. The bureaucratic bottleneck is not accidental. It is the predictable consequence of staffing an expanded mandate with a deliberately contracted workforce.

**The PACT Act Claims Surge:**

As of April 2025, the VBA was managing approximately 923,355 pending disability claims, with roughly one-quarter — approximately 230,000 — considered backlogged beyond the 125-day standard adjudication window. The VA was processing an average of 11,000 claims per day while receiving approximately 10,000 new claims daily, meaning the existing backlog was decreasing only marginally. The PACT Act's addition of new presumptive conditions in January 2025 — including specific leukemias, multiple myelomas, myelodysplastic syndromes, and genitourinary cancers — will generate an additional wave of claims that a workforce reduced by nearly 2,000 claims processors cannot timely adjudicate.

Appeals remain far more severe: veterans whose initial claims are denied wait an average of more than 1,000 days for appellate resolution. Terminating experienced claims processors does not merely slow initial adjudication; it increases error rates, increases denials that generate appeals, and cascades into a multi-year access failure for veterans whose survival may depend on receiving timely disability compensation.

---

### Damage Area 6: The Neglect of LGBTQ+ Veterans and Intersectional Veteran Populations

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 explicitly opposed recognition of LGBTQ+ identities within federal programs and called for the elimination of programs premised on recognition of gender identity. The Trump administration implemented this agenda within the VA through the termination of LGBTQ+-specific outreach programs, the elimination of the VA's LGBTQ+ Veteran Care Coordinator positions, and the implementation of the broader executive order rolling back transgender recognition in federal programs.

LGBTQ+ veterans face compounded health disparities. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals including the *American Journal of Public Health* document that LGBTQ+ veterans have significantly higher rates of PTSD, depression, suicidality, and MST than heterosexual and cisgender veterans. The elimination of dedicated VA care coordinators who understand these compounded health needs — and who provide culturally competent navigation of the VA system — directly harms a veteran population with above-average mental health acuity.

Transgender veterans who had received gender-affirming care within the VA system faced disruption of ongoing care under the Trump administration's reversal of VA policies permitting gender-affirming services. The interruption of gender-affirming hormone therapy or surgical continuity care constitutes a direct medical harm to an already-vulnerable population.

**The Next Administration's Obligation:**

The next Democratic administration will reinstate all LGBTQ+ Veteran Care Coordinator positions, restore gender-affirming care services within the VA as a covered benefit for enrolled transgender veterans, and direct VA to publish data on LGBTQ+ veteran health outcomes and access by facility — the first time the VA will systematically track whether it is serving this population equitably.

### The Human Cost

The aggregate human cost of the Project 2025 assault on the VA is not speculative. It is the sum of the following documented harms:

- More than 40,000 VA employees lost, including 3,000 nurses, 1,000 physicians, and 700 social workers, directly reducing the capacity to deliver care to 9 million enrolled veterans
- Plans to terminate an additional 83,000 workers — one in five VA employees — would eliminate the clinical and administrative infrastructure of the nation's largest integrated healthcare system
- Veterans experiencing homelessness: 32,882 as of January 2024, a number that will grow as housing support workers are terminated and HUD-VASH vouchers go unprocessed
- Veterans waiting for PACT Act claims: hundreds of thousands in a growing backlog driven by the elimination of claims processors
- Veterans crisis line contacts exceeding 1.3 million annually — a system under threat from the same workforce cuts that have already compromised clinical care
- The $37 billion Oracle-Cerner EHR failure: an inaccessible, unsafe system that cannot serve veterans with disabilities, deployed at an average cost of $100 million per month even while failing
- Rural veterans facing the elimination of low-volume rural clinics with no private-sector alternatives

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

Congress possesses plenary authority over veterans' benefits under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which grants Congress the power to raise and support armies, provide and maintain a Navy, and make all laws necessary and proper for executing these powers. The Supreme Court affirmed in *Walters v. National Association of Radiation Survivors*, 473 U.S. 305 (1985), that Congress has broad discretion in establishing the procedures by which veterans' claims are adjudicated. Congressional authority over VA appropriations is absolute; the executive cannot unilaterally eliminate congressionally mandated staffing levels or services.

The mass DOGE terminations of VA employees hired to implement the PACT Act directly violated the congressional mandate embedded in that statute. When Congress appropriates funds for specific purposes — including the hiring of claims processors and clinical staff to implement a new law — the executive branch lacks authority to impound or redirect those funds. The Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. § 1341) and the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. § 684) prohibit unilateral executive withholding of congressionally appropriated funds. The DOGE terminations were, in significant part, an unconstitutional impoundment of the legislative resources appropriated to implement statutory obligations.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**38 U.S.C. (Veterans' Benefits Act):** The foundational statutory framework for all VA benefits, establishing eligibility criteria, benefit categories, and administrative procedures for disability compensation, pension, education, home loan guaranty, life insurance, vocational rehabilitation, and burial benefits.

**38 U.S.C. § 1703 (Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act / MISSION Act):** Establishes the criteria under which veterans may access community care. The next administration will exercise its authority under this statute to tighten community care eligibility criteria, prioritize VA-delivered care, and require that community care referrals occur only when VA cannot deliver care within clinically appropriate timeframes — not to expand a privatization program.

**The PACT Act of 2022 (Pub. L. 117-168):** Amends Title 38 to establish presumptive service connection for approximately 90 conditions related to burn pit, Agent Orange, radiation, and other toxic exposures. Requires VA to screen all enrolled veterans for toxic exposure and to adjudicate claims under expanded presumptive standards. The next administration treats full PACT Act implementation as a non-negotiable statutory obligation.

**The Veterans Health Care Act (38 U.S.C. §§ 1701-1774):** Establishes the legal framework for VA healthcare delivery, including priority groups, copayment structures, and the requirement that VA deliver care directly to enrolled veterans.

**The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act (38 U.S.C. §§ 3301-3325):** Establishes the GI Bill benefit structure for post-9/11 veterans, including tuition, housing allowance, and books and supplies stipends.

**The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. § 3901 et seq.):** Provides legal protections for active-duty servicemembers, including interest rate caps, eviction protections, and stay provisions for civil proceedings.

**The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 794d, Section 508):** Requires all federal electronic and information technology to be accessible to individuals with disabilities. The Oracle-Cerner EHR system's non-compliance with Section 508 constitutes a legal violation that the next administration will immediately address.

**The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. § 7501 et seq.):** Establishes due process protections for federal employees, including the right to notice and a hearing before termination for cause. The DOGE mass terminations of VA employees without individualized cause determinations violated these statutory protections.

### Legal Analysis: The MISSION Act's Community Care Standards

The MISSION Act authorizes community care when: (1) VA cannot provide the care needed; (2) VA cannot furnish the care in a timely manner; (3) the veteran's medical condition requires frequent travel that is an undue burden; (4) the care is in the best medical interest of the veteran; or (5) the veteran is in a state without a full-service VA medical center. 38 U.S.C. § 1703(d).

The Project 2025 framework that instructs VA facilities to increase their community care referral rates — independent of whether any of these statutory criteria are met — violates the statute's text and intent. The next administration will issue implementing regulations under 38 C.F.R. Part 17 that require community care referrals to be individually justified against the statutory criteria, with documentation requirements that prevent programmatic privatization under the guise of access improvement.

---

## Part III: Comprehensive VA Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: Halt Privatization and Restore the VA's Integrated Care Model

#### Reversal of Community Care Overexpansion

The next administration will direct the Under Secretary for Health to issue immediate guidance suspending all pending expansions of community care referral volumes and requiring that any community care referral be individually documented against the statutory criteria established at 38 U.S.C. § 1703(d). No VA facility will be evaluated against referral volume targets or penalized for providing direct VA care.

The administration will propose legislation to amend the MISSION Act to clarify that community care is a supplement to VA direct care — not a substitute for it — and to prohibit the use of referral rate metrics as a performance indicator for VA facility leadership. VA facility capacity investment will be restored as the primary vehicle for expanding veteran access to care, with community care serving as a genuine safety valve rather than a privatization pipeline.

The $14.4 billion community care funding increase proposed by the Trump administration will be redirected: 50 percent will fund VA clinical staffing restoration; 30 percent will fund VA facility modernization; and 20 percent will fund community care for geographically isolated veterans where VA direct delivery is genuinely not feasible.

#### Structural Protection of the VA Healthcare System

The administration will issue an executive order establishing that the VA's Veterans Health Administration is an essential government function that cannot be contracted out, privatized, or eliminated except by act of Congress. This order will prohibit any VA leadership official from taking administrative action the primary purpose or effect of which is to transfer clinical care responsibilities from the VHA to private providers without specific congressional authorization.

---

### Reform II: Restore the VA Workforce and Rebuild Institutional Capacity

#### Reinstatement of Unlawfully Terminated Employees

The administration will direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to immediately reinstate all VA employees terminated through DOGE-directed mass firings who did not receive individualized cause determinations as required by 5 U.S.C. § 7513. Reinstatement will include back pay, restoration of retirement credit, and restoration of seniority. The administration will refer evidence of unlawful terminations to the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel for appropriate action.

#### PACT Act Staffing Mandate

Congress appropriated staffing resources to implement the PACT Act. The next administration will treat those appropriations as binding obligations and will hire to meet the statutory mandate. Within 90 days of taking office, the Secretary will issue a workforce plan identifying the specific clinical, claims processing, and administrative positions required to meet PACT Act implementation timelines, with hiring targets established by position category and VA region.

Priority hiring will target: claims processors (minimum 5,000 additional FTEs); mental health providers (minimum 3,000 additional FTEs); toxic exposure clinical specialists (minimum 1,500 additional FTEs); and rural clinic staff to reopen facilities closed by DOGE cuts. The administration will use 38 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq. (Title 38 hybrid authorities) to accelerate VA healthcare hiring outside traditional competitive service timelines.

#### Protecting VA Employees Against Political Interference

The administration will issue a rule under 5 C.F.R. Part 752 clarifying that VA employees may not be terminated on the basis of participation in congressionally mandated programs, advocacy for veteran welfare, or disagreement with administration policy expressed through protected channels. The VA Inspector General will be given direct referral authority to the Office of Special Counsel in cases of suspected political retaliation against VA employees.

---

### Reform III: Fix the Electronic Health Records System

#### Termination of the Oracle-Cerner Contract

The administration will conduct an immediate independent assessment of the Oracle-Cerner EHR system's patient safety record, technical capability, and Section 508 compliance status. Based on the publicly documented evidence of cost overruns (from $10 billion to $37 billion), patient safety incidents, and persistent inaccessibility for veterans with disabilities, the assessment will evaluate contract termination under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R. Part 49) and transition to an alternative system.

The administration will issue a contract modification immediately suspending all new Oracle-Cerner deployment sites pending the independent safety assessment. The $100 million monthly payments to Oracle-Cerner during operational pause will be halted pending contract renegotiation or termination.

#### Transition to an Open-Source, VA-Controlled System

The next administration will commission a technical evaluation of open-source electronic health record systems, including systems built on VA's own VistA codebase, as alternatives to the Oracle-Cerner platform. The evaluation will prioritize: Section 508 compliance from deployment; interoperability with DoD's MHS GENESIS system; support for VA's specialized clinical modules (mental health, spinal cord injury, polytrauma, prosthetics); and total cost of ownership over a 20-year horizon.

The administration will propose an EHR Accountability Act requiring that any VA electronic health record system be fully accessible to veterans with disabilities within 12 months of deployment, with contract termination as the penalty for non-compliance.

---

### Reform IV: Full PACT Act Implementation

#### Eliminating the Toxic Exposure Claims Backlog

The administration will establish a Toxic Exposure Claims Emergency Unit within the Veterans Benefits Administration, staffed by the reinstated and newly hired claims processors identified under Reform II, with a mandate to eliminate the PACT Act claims backlog within 24 months. The unit will operate under an expedited adjudication framework that:

- Applies presumptive service connection automatically to all conditions listed in the PACT Act's statutory schedules without requiring veterans to prove individual causation
- Assigns dedicated case managers to veterans with multiple toxic-exposure-related conditions to coordinate concurrent claims processing
- Provides interim compensation to veterans with confirmed PACT Act-covered conditions pending final adjudication, funded under 38 U.S.C. § 5110

#### Expanding Presumptive Coverage

The administration will direct the VA's Advisory Committee on Disability Compensation to conduct a review of all conditions for which scientific evidence supports a presumptive service connection relationship with burn pit, Agent Orange, radiation, or other toxic exposures but that are not yet covered under the PACT Act. The Secretary will use rulemaking authority under 38 U.S.C. § 1113 to add additional presumptive conditions consistent with the evidence base, without waiting for congressional action.

#### Agent Orange Full Implementation

The administration will complete the long-delayed extension of Agent Orange presumptive coverage to Blue Water Navy veterans (implemented only partially under prior administrations) and will ensure that Camp Lejeune contaminated water exposure claims are adjudicated within the 90-day expedited timeline established by the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022.

---

### Reform V: End Veteran Homelessness

#### A Fully Funded Housing First Mandate

The 2024 Point-in-Time Count identified 32,882 veterans experiencing homelessness, with 13,851 unsheltered. The next administration commits to ending veteran homelessness by 2030, defined as achieving a state of functional zero — meaning every veteran experiencing homelessness is quickly connected to permanent housing with the supportive services needed to maintain stability.

The administration will fully fund the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program at a level sufficient to house every veteran currently on the waitlist within 18 months, and to eliminate the waitlist entirely by 2027. HUD-VASH is authorized under 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(19) and pairs HUD Section 8 housing vouchers with VA case management services. The program has a documented track record: the VA permanently housed 51,936 homeless veterans in fiscal year 2025. Adequate funding eliminates the waitlist that prevents scaling this result.

The Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program, which provides rapid rehousing and homelessness prevention assistance, will be funded at a minimum of $750 million annually — an increase from current appropriations — to reach the estimated 35,000 veterans at imminent risk of homelessness in any given year.

#### Addressing Root Causes

The administration recognizes that veteran homelessness is not separable from the broader housing affordability crisis, the mental health crisis, or the substance use disorder epidemic. The VA Secretary will coordinate with the Secretaries of HUD, HHS, and Labor to establish integrated veteran-specific programs that address: affordable housing production in high-cost areas with large veteran populations; substance use disorder treatment integrated into housing case management; and employment support for veterans transitioning from homelessness to stable work.

---

### Reform VI: Zero-Delay Mental Health Access

#### Achieving Timely Access to Mental Health Care

The administration will establish, by executive directive, a standard that no enrolled veteran will wait more than 14 days for an initial mental health appointment at a VA facility. This standard exists in VA policy but is not consistently enforced. The administration will tie facility director performance evaluations to wait time compliance, fund the additional mental health provider positions necessary to meet the standard (minimum 3,000 FTEs as specified in Reform II), and establish a veteran-accessible real-time dashboard publishing wait times at every VA facility and community mental health provider in the VA network.

#### Strengthening the Veterans Crisis Line

The Veterans Crisis Line — the 988-then-1 system that received more than 1.3 million contacts in fiscal year 2025 — will be funded as a non-negotiable priority at a minimum of $350 million annually, indexed to contact volume. The administration will prohibit DOGE or any executive-branch cost-reduction initiative from affecting Veterans Crisis Line staffing without explicit congressional authorization.

#### Trauma-Informed Suicide Prevention

The VA will implement a comprehensive firearms safety counseling program for veterans at elevated suicide risk, consistent with the research demonstrating that 73.3 percent of veteran suicides involve firearms. This program will not restrict veterans' constitutional rights but will provide voluntary lethal means counseling, cable locks and gun safes through VA facilities, and coordination with community partners. The program will be integrated with every VA primary care, mental health, and emergency encounter.

The administration will fund expansion of VA residential treatment programs for veterans with PTSD, substance use disorder comorbidities, and TBI — the conditions most strongly associated with elevated suicide risk. Current residential treatment capacity is insufficient to serve the veteran population requiring this level of care.

---

### Reform VII: Women Veterans Equity

#### Comprehensive Women's Health Infrastructure

Women are the fastest-growing segment of the veteran population, comprising approximately 17 percent of active-duty military personnel and a growing share of VA enrollees. The VA has historically been designed around male veterans, and women veterans consistently report lower satisfaction with VA care, longer wait times for gender-specific care, and inadequate infrastructure at VA facilities.

The administration will require that every VA Medical Center establish a dedicated Women's Health Center providing comprehensive primary care, reproductive health, obstetrics referral coordination, gynecology, mammography, and gender-specific mental health services under one roof. No woman veteran will be required to travel to a separate facility to access basic reproductive health services covered by VA. This mandate will be implemented through a rulemaking under 38 C.F.R. Part 17 within 180 days of taking office.

#### Military Sexual Trauma Survivor Services

Approximately 1 in 3 women veterans and a significant percentage of men report experiencing military sexual trauma (MST). The VA provides free MST-related care regardless of other eligibility requirements, but access to specialized MST programs varies dramatically by facility and geography.

The administration will establish a minimum staffing standard for MST specialists at every VA Medical Center (minimum one full-time equivalent per 5,000 women veterans enrolled); expand VA's MST residential treatment programs to ensure availability in every VA region; and require that every VA mental health provider complete trauma-informed care training specifically addressing MST dynamics. The VA's Beyond MST mobile app will be expanded and actively promoted as a supplement — not a substitute — for in-person care.

The administration will direct the VA to eliminate the documentation requirement for MST-related disability claims and establish a rebuttable presumption of service connection for MST-related mental health conditions consistent with the evidence base on MST prevalence in the military.

### Reform VIII: Rural Veteran Telehealth Expansion

#### Closing the Rural Access Gap

Approximately 5 million of the nation's 18 million veterans live in rural or highly rural areas. For these veterans, the nearest VA Medical Center may be 100 miles away. The DOGE cuts to low-volume rural clinics — rationalized as efficiency measures — eliminated care access for veterans with no private-sector alternative.

The administration will reopen all rural VA clinics closed after January 20, 2025, and establish a moratorium on future rural clinic closures without congressional notification and a 90-day public comment period. Every rural clinic closure proposal will require a documented access impact analysis demonstrating that equivalent or superior care will be available to affected veterans within the same geographic catchment area.

#### VA-Operated Mobile Health Units

The administration will fund a fleet of VA-operated mobile health units providing primary care, mental health, dental, and telehealth services to veterans in geographic areas without fixed VA facility access. Mobile units will be staffed by VA employees — not contracted to private providers — to maintain the integrated care model and ensure access to the VA's full electronic health record system.

#### Eliminating Telehealth Connectivity Barriers

The administration will coordinate with the FCC and USDA's Rural Development programs to ensure that every veteran household has access to the broadband connectivity required for video telehealth appointments. VA will provide loaner devices and cellular data plans to veterans who lack the technology to access telehealth services, funded under the existing VA telehealth program authorities at 38 U.S.C. § 1701 note.

The proposed elimination of copays for telehealth services — announced in proposed rulemaking during the Biden administration but not finalized — will be finalized within 90 days of taking office.

---

### Reform IX: GI Bill and Educational Benefits Protection

#### Protecting Veterans from Predatory Institutions

For-profit colleges disproportionately target veterans, collecting GI Bill tuition while providing low-quality credentials that do not translate to employment. The administration will reinstate and strengthen the Gainful Employment Rule (34 C.F.R. Part 668, Subpart Q) specifically as applied to GI Bill-eligible institutions, requiring disclosure of graduation rates, loan default rates, and post-graduation employment and earnings outcomes for all programs receiving more than 25 percent of revenue from VA educational benefits.

The administration will reinstate the 90/10 Rule enforcement (20 U.S.C. § 1094(a)(24)) to prevent for-profit colleges from exceeding 90 percent VA and federal student aid funding, closing a loophole that allowed schools to evade accountability while maximizing GI Bill revenue.

#### Expanding GI Bill Access and Duration

The administration will propose legislation extending Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility to veterans discharged under other than honorable conditions who were not afforded meaningful due process, and to reserve component veterans whose service-connected injuries prevented them from completing minimum service requirements for GI Bill eligibility. Character of discharge determinations for GI Bill purposes will be conducted under a rebuttable presumption of eligibility with individualized review.

The administration will eliminate processing delays in GI Bill payments — currently affecting hundreds of thousands of student veterans — by funding the School Certifying Official infrastructure at VA and streamlining the enrollment certification process.

### Reform X: LGBTQ+ Veteran Services and Intersectional Care

#### Restoring LGBTQ+ Veteran Care Coordinators

The Trump administration eliminated VA's LGBTQ+ Veteran Care Coordinator positions as part of its executive order rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion programs throughout the federal government. These coordinators provided culturally competent navigation of the VA system for a veteran population that faces documented compounded health disparities. Research published in the *American Journal of Public Health* and peer-reviewed military health journals documents that LGBTQ+ veterans experience significantly higher rates of PTSD, depression, suicidality, and MST than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.

The administration will reinstate all LGBTQ+ Veteran Care Coordinator positions within 60 days and establish a statutory minimum staffing standard of one LGBTQ+ specialist per 15,000 enrolled veterans at each VA healthcare system, funded under 38 U.S.C. § 7401 hiring authorities.

#### Restoring Gender-Affirming Care

The VA began providing gender-affirming care services to enrolled transgender veterans during the Obama administration, a policy sustained and expanded under Biden. The Trump administration reversed this policy, interrupting ongoing hormone therapy and surgical continuity care for transgender veterans who had been receiving treatment within the VA system.

The interruption of gender-affirming hormone therapy is not an administrative inconvenience — it is a direct medical harm. Abrupt cessation of hormone therapy causes measurable physiological harm, and the associated psychological distress is documented in clinical literature as a suicide risk factor. The next administration will:

- Restore gender-affirming care as a covered VA benefit within 30 days through Secretarial directive under 38 U.S.C. § 1710
- Provide back-authorization for gender-affirming care expenses incurred by transgender veterans forced into the private sector after the Trump-era policy reversal
- Direct VA to publish an annual report on transgender veteran health outcomes and access by facility
- Prohibit any future Secretarial directive from eliminating gender-affirming care without an Act of Congress

#### Eliminating MST-Related Access Barriers for LGBTQ+ Veterans

LGBTQ+ veterans experience military sexual trauma at rates substantially higher than the general veteran population, and they face additional barriers — including fear of discrimination and non-affirming care environments — in accessing MST-related services within the VA. The administration will require that every VA MST specialist receive training specifically addressing the intersection of MST and LGBTQ+ identity, and will establish affirmative protocols for ensuring that LGBTQ+ veterans presenting with MST-related conditions are offered affirming care pathways.

---

### Reform XI: VA Accountability, Transparency, and Inspector General Independence

#### Ending Political Interference in VA Operations

Project 2025's explicit goal of placing more political appointees in VA leadership positions — and removing Senior Executive Service career officials who resist political direction — creates the structural conditions for subordinating veteran welfare to political objectives. The VA's mission is the care of veterans, not the advancement of any administration's political agenda. When political appointees direct clinical prioritization decisions, benefits adjudication policy, or workforce management in ways that harm veterans to achieve ideological goals, the result is a corruption of the VA's statutory purpose.

The administration will reinstate all career Senior Executive Service officials removed from VA positions for reasons other than individual documented misconduct, restore the delegations of authority rescinded by the Trump administration, and establish an administrative record of all political-appointee directives that affected clinical or benefits operations from January 20, 2025 onward — to enable accountability and restoration.

#### Strengthening the VA Inspector General

The VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) has authority under the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App. 3) to conduct audits, investigations, and inspections of VA programs and operations and to refer evidence of criminal conduct to the Department of Justice. The Trump administration's broader assault on inspectors general — including the mass firing of IGs across multiple agencies in January 2025 — created a vulnerability in VA accountability infrastructure.

The administration will:

- Restore and protect the independence of the VA Inspector General from Secretarial direction on investigation priorities, consistent with 5 U.S.C. App. 3 § 3
- Fund the VA OIG at a minimum of $350 million annually — an increase from current appropriations — with dedicated staff to investigate PACT Act claims fraud, procurement fraud in the EHR modernization program, and political interference with benefits adjudication
- Establish a VA Whistleblower Protection Unit within OIG, with dedicated resources to investigate retaliation against VA employees who report waste, fraud, abuse, or political interference with veteran care
- Require quarterly OIG reports to Congress on VA wait time accuracy, claims processing integrity, and community care billing fraud

#### VA Transparency and Public Accountability

The next administration will publish the first-ever comprehensive VA Transparency Dashboard: a publicly accessible, real-time database providing facility-level data on wait times by appointment type, staffing levels by position category, PACT Act claims processing status by condition type, veteran satisfaction scores, and adverse clinical event rates. Veterans and their families will have access to the data needed to hold their VA facilities accountable and to advocate for the resources those facilities need.

The administration will require VA to publish an annual State of Veterans' Healthcare Report, submitted to Congress and publicly released simultaneously, providing a candid assessment of progress, shortfalls, and resource requirements. This report will be prepared by career officials, not political appointees, and will be subject to OIG review for factual accuracy before submission.
