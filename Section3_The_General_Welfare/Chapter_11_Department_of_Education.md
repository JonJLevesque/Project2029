# Chapter 11: Department of Education - Education for Citizenship

## Executive Summary

Project 2025 sought to eliminate the Department of Education and gut civic education programs. Project 2029 does the opposite: a major expansion and modernization to strengthen democracy through civic literacy, critical thinking, media literacy, and democratic values education. An informed citizenry is democracy's best defense against authoritarianism.

## The Project 2025 Damage Assessment

- Planned elimination of Department of Education
- Federal education funding cuts
- Title I and IDEA underfunded
- Privatization and voucher schemes
- Public school destabilization

### Civic Education Gutted
- Civics and history programs eliminated
- AP courses politicized or banned
- "Divisive concepts" laws restricting teaching
- Book banning and curriculum censorship
- Teacher intimidation and exodus

### Democratic Education Under Attack
- Critical thinking discouraged
- Media literacy programs eliminated

## Part II: Higher Education Affordability and Access

### XI. The Higher Education Crisis

**The Problem:**

**Student Debt Emergency:**
- $1.7 trillion in outstanding student debt
- 44 million borrowers
- Average debt at graduation: $30,000+ (four-year public)
- Graduate/professional debt: $100,000+
- Debt-to-income ratios preventing homeownership, family formation, economic participation

**Tuition Explosion:**
- Tuition increased 1,200% since 1980 (vs. 236% inflation)
- State disinvestment: Public universities now rely on tuition, not state support
- Average public university: $10,000+ per year (in-state)
- Average private university: $40,000+ per year
- Community college (supposedly affordable): $3,500+ per year

**Access Inequality:**
- College completion rates stratified by income
- High-income students 8x more likely to complete than low-income
- First-generation students face systematic barriers
- For-profit colleges exploit students with minimal outcomes
- Geographic barriers: Rural students lack access

**The "Buy, Borrow, Die" of Higher Education:**
1. Families told college is essential
2. Costs exceed what families can afford
3. Students borrow (often without understanding terms)
4. Graduate into economy that doesn't pay enough to repay
5. Debt follows them for decades, limiting life choices
6. Default, garnishment, destroyed credit

### XII. Free Public Higher Education

**Policy Design:**

**Core Principle:** Higher education is a public good, not a consumer product. Just as K-12 education is publicly funded, higher education should be publicly funded.

**Tuition-Free Public Higher Education:**

| Family Income | Benefit |
|---------------|---------|
| Under $60,000 | Free tuition + fees + living expenses at public institutions |
| $60,000 - $125,000 | Free tuition + fees at public institutions |
| $125,000 - $200,000 | Subsidized tuition (50-75% covered) + need-based aid |
| Over $200,000 | Standard financial aid (no additional subsidy) |

**What's Covered:**
- **Community colleges:** Free for ALL students regardless of income
- **Public universities:** Free tuition + fees for families under $125K
- **Living expenses:** Covered for lowest-income students (room, board, books, transportation)
- **Includes:** State universities, community colleges, tribal colleges, HBCUs (where public)

**What's Not Covered (by this program):**
- Private universities (but Pell Grants doubled, available for private)
- Graduate/professional programs (addressed separately)
- For-profit institutions (ineligible for federal support)

**Funding Mechanism:**

**Federal-State Partnership:**
- Federal government: 2/3 of cost
- States: 1/3 of cost
- **Condition:** States must maintain current higher ed funding levels (no supplanting)
- **Incentive:** Additional federal match for states that exceed maintenance of effort

**Estimated Cost:** $80 billion annually (federal share)

**Implementation:**
- **Year 1:** Community college free for all
- **Year 2:** Public university tuition-free for families under $60K
- **Year 3:** Full implementation (families under $125K)

**Legal Basis:**
- Spending Clause: Federal grants to states for education
- Model: GI Bill (free education for veterans)
- Model: Land Grant universities (federal support for public higher education)

### XIII. Income-Based Repayment Reform

**Current Problems:**
- Multiple confusing plans (ICR, IBR, PAYE, REPAYE, SAVE)
- Interest capitalization increases principal (borrowers owe more than they borrowed)
- 20-25 year forgiveness timeline
- Forgiven amounts taxed as income (phantom income tax bomb)
- Complex certification and recertification
- Servicer errors and mismanagement

**Simplified IBR System:**

**Single Universal Plan:**
- **Payment:** 10% of discretionary income
- **Discretionary income:** Income above 200% of federal poverty line
- **Example:** Single person earning $40,000: Discretionary = $40,000 - $30,120 = $9,880; Payment = $988/year ($82/month)

**Forgiveness:**
- **Standard:** 20 years of payments (any employment)
- **Public Service:** 10 years of payments (government, nonprofit, teaching, healthcare)
- **Tax-free:** Forgiven amounts NOT taxed as income

**Interest Subsidy:**
- Payments cover interest first
- Government subsidizes interest if payment doesn't cover
- Principal never increases due to capitalization
- If payment covers interest: principal decreases
- If payment < interest: government pays difference, balance stays flat

**Automatic Enrollment:**
- IBR automatic for all federal borrowers
- Income verified through IRS data sharing
- No recertification paperwork
- Automatic adjustments when income changes

### XIV. Existing Student Debt Cancellation

**Policy Design:**

**Broad-Based Cancellation:**
| Borrower Category | Cancellation Amount |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| All federal borrowers | $10,000 |
| Pell Grant recipients | $20,000 additional ($30,000 total) |
| Borrowers in IBR 20+ years | 100% (full cancellation) |
| Borrowers with income < $50K | $50,000 |
| Borrowers defrauded by for-profit colleges | 100% (full cancellation) |

**Retroactive PSLF Fix:**
- Credit ALL qualifying payments (regardless of payment plan)
- Reverse denials based on technicalities
- Automatic review of all applications
- Immediate forgiveness for those who already qualified

**Borrower Defense Expansion:**
- Automatic cancellation for students defrauded by for-profit colleges
- ITT Tech, Corinthian, Art Institutes, others: Full discharge
- No individual application required
- Group discharge process

**Legal Basis:**
- **Higher Education Act Section 432(a):** Secretary may "compromise, waive, or release" federal student loans
- **Executive authority:** If Congress fails to act, administrative cancellation (contested but defensible)
- **Legislation preferable:** Clear statutory authorization removes legal uncertainty

**Cost:** $300-500 billion (one-time)

**Economic Impact:**
- Consumer spending increase: Freed from debt payments, borrowers spend in economy
- Homeownership increase: Debt-free borrowers can qualify for mortgages
- Family formation: Remove barrier to having children
- Entrepreneurship: Debt-free graduates can take risks, start businesses
- Racial wealth gap reduction: Black and Latino borrowers disproportionately burdened

### XV. Teacher Compensation Revolution

**The Crisis:**
- Average teacher salary: $65,000 (vs. $80,000+ comparable professions)
- Teacher shortage: 300,000+ unfilled positions nationally
- 50%+ of teachers leave within 5 years
- Low salaries deter talented candidates
- Disproportionate impact on high-poverty schools (hardest positions, lowest pay)
- Political attacks on teachers accelerating exodus

**$80,000 Minimum Teacher Salary Target:**

**Federal Incentive Structure:**
- States that establish $80K minimum teacher salary receive substantial federal support
- **Federal match:** 50% of cost to reach $80K from current salary
- **Targeting:** Priority funding for high-poverty schools
- **Professional development:** Additional funds for ongoing training

**Example:**
- Current average salary: $60,000
- Target: $80,000
- Increase needed: $20,000
- Federal contribution: $10,000 per teacher
- State contribution: $10,000 per teacher

**Implementation:**
- Year 1: States opt in, receive planning grants
- Year 2-4: Federal matching begins, phased salary increases
- Year 5: All participating states at $80K minimum

**Estimated Cost:** $10 billion annually (federal share)

**Teacher Loan Forgiveness Acceleration:**

**Current PSLF:** 10 years of payments for forgiveness
**Teacher-Specific Program:**
- 5-year full forgiveness for teachers in:
  - Title I schools
  - High-need subject areas (STEM, special education, bilingual)
  - Shortage areas
- Immediate forgiveness for teachers with 10+ years in Title I schools

**Teacher Housing Assistance:**
- Down payment assistance programs in high-cost areas
- Preference in social housing for educators
- HUD-Education coordination for educator housing
- Tax incentives for teacher housing near schools

**Recruitment Pipeline:**
- Grow Your Own programs (community members become teachers)
- Teacher residency programs (apprenticeship model)
- Alternative certification support (career changers)
- Diverse teacher recruitment initiatives

### XVI. Anti-Privatization Measures

**The Threat:**

**Voucher Programs:**
- Divert public funds to private schools
- Often religious schools (Establishment Clause concerns)
- No accountability for outcomes
- "Skimming" (private schools select easiest-to-educate students)
- Public schools left with harder-to-serve students and less funding

**Charter Schools (without accountability):**
- Some charters excellent; many are not
- Financial scandals, fraud, mismanagement
- Selective enrollment (excluding special needs, English learners)
- No transparency requirements
- Drain public school funding

**For-Profit Colleges:**
- Predatory recruitment (targeting veterans, low-income)
- Terrible outcomes (high debt, low graduation, worthless credentials)
- 90/10 loophole exploitation (VA benefits)
- Student loan default rates highest in sector

**Policy Design:**

**Voucher Prohibition:**
- No federal funds for voucher programs diverting to private schools
- Tax credit scholarship programs: Close loopholes
- Condition federal education funding on states not implementing new voucher programs
- Respect state decisions on existing programs, but no federal support

**Charter School Accountability:**
- Charter schools receiving public funds must meet same requirements as public schools:
  - Financial transparency (public disclosure)
  - Non-discrimination (cannot exclude students)
  - Special education compliance (full IDEA implementation)
  - Teacher certification requirements
  - Performance standards (close low-performing charters)
- Authorization review: Regular performance evaluation
- Financial audits: Annual independent audit required

**For-Profit College Crackdown:**

**Gainful Employment Rule Restoration:**
- Programs must lead to gainful employment
- Debt-to-earnings ratios enforced
- Programs failing metrics lose Title IV eligibility
- Student warnings required for low-performing programs

**90/10 Rule Enforcement:**
- For-profits must get 10%+ of revenue from non-federal sources
- GI Bill/VA benefits count as federal (close loophole)
- Strict enforcement with sanctions for violations

**Recruiting Restrictions:**
- Ban incentive compensation (paid per enrollment)
- No recruiting at homeless shelters, unemployment offices
- Mandatory cooling-off period before enrollment
- Clear disclosure of costs, outcomes, alternatives

### XVII. Academic Freedom Protection Act

**The Attack on Academic Freedom:**

**"Divisive Concepts" Laws:**
- 20+ states passed laws restricting teaching about race, gender, history
- Vague language creates chilling effect
- Teachers afraid to teach accurate history
- Self-censorship widespread

**Book Banning:**
- 4,000+ book challenges in 2022-23 (record)
- Targeting LGBTQ+ content, racial topics, "uncomfortable" history
- Organized campaigns to remove books
- Libraries and classrooms gutted

**Teacher Intimidation:**
- Surveillance and reporting systems ("tip lines")
- Political attacks on individual teachers
- Threats of license revocation
- Hostile school board takeovers

**Policy Design:**

**Federal Academic Freedom Protection Act:**

**K-12 Protections:**
- **Preempt "divisive concepts" laws:** Federal law establishes that curriculum meeting professional education standards cannot be restricted based on viewpoint
- **Anti-book-banning provision:** No federal funds to districts that ban books based on viewpoint or identity of author/characters
- **Teacher protection:** No discipline for teaching accurate history, science, current events consistent with professional standards

**Mechanism:**
- Schools receiving federal funds must maintain academic freedom
- Compliance monitored through civil rights data collection
- Complaints investigated by Department of Education OCR
- Remedies: Technical assistance, compliance agreements, fund withholding

**Higher Education:**
- **Institutional autonomy:** Protect from state political interference
- **Tenure protection:** No weakening based on content of scholarship/teaching
- **Research freedom:** No restrictions on topics of inquiry
- **Student free speech:** Protect student expression, journalism

**Legal Basis:**
- **First Amendment:** Teachers and students have speech rights (*Tinker v. Des Moines*, *Keyishian v. Board of Regents*)
- **Spending Clause:** Condition federal funds on academic freedom
- **Civil Rights:** Title VI implications of viewpoint-based restrictions

**Teacher Legal Defense Fund:**
- $100 million annually for teacher legal defense
- Administered through Department of Education
- Cover attorneys' fees for teachers facing discipline over curriculum
- Support ACLU, NAACP Legal Defense, and education law organizations

### XVIII. School-to-Prison Pipeline Dismantling

**The Problem:**

**Criminalization of Students:**
- 14 million students in schools with police but no counselors
- Black students 3x more likely to be suspended than white students
- Students with disabilities disproportionately disciplined
- School arrests for minor infractions (dress code, talking back)
- School resource officers: Often escalate rather than de-escalate

**Consequences:**
- Suspensions predict dropout, incarceration
- Criminal records from school incidents follow students
- Lost instruction time
- Trauma from encounters with police
- Pipeline to adult criminal justice system

**Policy Design:**

**End Police in Schools:**
- Condition federal funding on removing School Resource Officers
- Exception: Only where documented security need AND community approval through transparent process
- Redirect SRO funding to counselors, social workers, restorative justice staff
- No criminalization of normal adolescent behavior

**Restorative Justice:**
- Federal grants for restorative justice programs
- Training for teachers and administrators
- Evidence-based discipline alternatives
- Peer mediation, circle processes, community conferencing
- Reduce out-of-school suspensions 50%+ through alternatives

**Discipline Disparity Monitoring:**
- Enhanced OCR Civil Rights Data Collection
- Automatic investigation triggers for extreme disparities
- Consent decrees for persistent violators
- Coordination with DOJ Civil Rights Division

**Mental Health Investment:**
- **Target:** 1 counselor per 250 students (current: 1 per 500+)
- Social workers in all high-need schools
- Trauma-informed practices training for all staff
- Mental health crisis response (not police)
- Community mental health partnerships

**Success Metrics:**
- Suspension rates: Reduce 50%
- Suspension disparities: Eliminate
- School arrests: Reduce 75%
- Counselor ratios: 1:250 achieved
- Restorative justice programs: In 50% of schools

## Conclusion

Education is democracy's immune system. An informed, critically thinking, media-literate citizenry is the ultimate safeguard against authoritarianism. Project 2025 sought to dismantle civic education because educated citizens threaten authoritarian power.

Project 2029 invests massively in civic education—not to indoctrinate, but to equip citizens with the knowledge and skills democracy requires. We teach:
- How democracy works
- How to think critically
- How to navigate information
- How to engage constructively
- How to preserve and strengthen self-government

This is our most important investment in democracy's future. Every dollar spent on civic education returns dividends in democratic vitality for generations.

The battle for democracy is fought in classrooms as much as courtrooms. We choose to win it.
