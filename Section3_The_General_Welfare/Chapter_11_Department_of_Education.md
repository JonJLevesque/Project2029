# Chapter 11: Department of Education - Education for Citizenship

## Executive Summary

Project 2025 sought to eliminate the Department of Education and gut civic education programs. Project 2029 does the opposite: a major expansion and modernization to strengthen democracy through civic literacy, critical thinking, media literacy, and democratic values education. An informed citizenry is democracy's best defense against authoritarianism.

## Conclusion

Education is democracy's immune system. An informed, critically thinking, media-literate citizenry is the ultimate safeguard against authoritarianism. Project 2025 sought to dismantle civic education because educated citizens threaten authoritarian power.

Project 2029 invests massively in civic education—not to indoctrinate, but to equip citizens with the knowledge and skills democracy requires. We teach:
- How democracy works
- How to think critically
- How to navigate information
- How to engage constructively
- How to preserve and strengthen self-government

This is our most important investment in democracy's future. Every dollar spent on civic education returns dividends in democratic vitality for generations.

The battle for democracy is fought in classrooms as much as courtrooms. We choose to win it.
