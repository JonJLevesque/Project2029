# Chapter 18: Department of Labor and Related Agencies

## Executive Summary

The Department of Labor (DOL) stands as the federal government's primary institutional guardian of American workers. Established in 1913, the Department oversees more than 180 federal laws covering approximately 10 million employers and 125 million workers. Its core divisions — the Wage and Hour Division (WHD), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) — form the legal architecture that separates a civilized labor market from exploitation. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), while an independent agency, operates in close coordination with DOL and its mandate is inseparable from the department's mission.

Project 2025 treats the Department of Labor as an obstacle to be dismantled rather than an institution to be stewarded. The Heritage Foundation's blueprint — developed by former DOL officials who operated under the Trump administration's first term — calls for rolling back overtime protections, gutting OSHA enforcement, narrowing the legal definition of "concerted activity" under the National Labor Relations Act, promoting employer-designed Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs) that circumvent union-negotiated standards, reversing independent contractor classification rules that protect gig workers, and decentralizing federal labor law enforcement to states that have demonstrated hostility to worker rights. These are not administrative adjustments. They are coordinated assaults on the legal foundations that prevent wage theft, workplace injury, and union suppression.

A restorative and transformative Democratic administration must move immediately to reverse Project 2025's labor agenda and then advance beyond restoration into structural reform. The right to organize, the right to a living wage, the right to safe working conditions, and the right to bargain collectively are not privileges to be granted by employers. They are legally grounded rights recognized in federal statute, and this administration will enforce them as such — with criminal referrals for wage thieves, full OSHA enforcement against dangerous employers, and legislative action to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act and a federal paid family leave program.

**The Stakes**: Approximately $50 billion is stolen from American workers annually through wage theft — a figure that dwarfs all conventional property crime combined. Union membership has fallen from 35 percent of the workforce in the 1950s to 9.9 percent in 2024. More than 5,000 workers died on the job in 2023 alone. Approximately 73 percent of private-sector workers have no access to paid family leave. Approximately 59 million Americans — more than a third of the workforce — engage in gig or freelance work, with millions systematically misclassified as independent contractors and denied the basic protections of federal labor law. The Department of Labor, if resourced and led with genuine commitment to its statutory mandate, is the primary vehicle for reversing each of these failures. The question is not whether the federal government has the authority to act. The question is whether it has the will.

**Key Reforms**:
- Raise the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour, indexed to inflation thereafter
- Restore the Biden-era overtime salary threshold of $58,656 and pursue legislative indexing
- Pass the PRO Act to restore the right to organize, ban captive audience meetings, and enable card check recognition
- Fully fund OSHA with mandatory inspection staffing ratios and criminal referrals for willful violations causing death
- Enforce independent contractor classification rules and protect gig workers from systematic misclassification
- Establish a federal paid family and medical leave program through the FAMILY Act framework
- Prosecute wage theft as the federal crime it is, with DOJ referrals for repeat violators
- Rebuild the Registered Apprenticeship system under DOL standards, reversing IRAP privatization
- Restore and expand NLRB jurisdiction, staffing, and enforcement capacity
- Pilot sectoral bargaining models in high-density industries

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.); National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq.); Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. § 651 et seq.); Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. § 3141 et seq.); Service Contract Act (41 U.S.C. § 6701 et seq.); Employee Retirement Income Security Act (29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.); Family and Medical Leave Act (29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.); National Apprenticeship Act (29 U.S.C. § 50 et seq.); Commerce Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3); Spending Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1).

## Part I: Project 2025 Labor Department Damage and Destruction

### The Assault on Overtime Protections

**What Project 2025 Did:**

**Rollback of the Overtime Salary Threshold**: The Biden administration's 2024 final rule under the Fair Labor Standards Act raised the salary threshold for overtime exemptions in two phases: from $35,568 to $43,888 on July 1, 2024, and then to $58,656 on January 1, 2025, covering approximately 4.3 million additional salaried workers. A federal court in the Eastern District of Texas struck down the rule on November 15, 2024, reverting the threshold to $35,568. Project 2025 not only endorsed this rollback but proposed returning the threshold to approximately $35,000 permanently, ensuring that millions of salaried workers earning between $35,000 and $58,656 annually remain ineligible for overtime pay regardless of how many hours they work.

**Biweekly and Multiweekly Averaging**: Project 2025 calls for allowing employers to calculate overtime over two- or four-week periods rather than the standard 40-hour workweek mandated by 29 U.S.C. § 207. This proposal would allow employers to avoid paying overtime premiums by averaging hours across longer pay periods, directly reducing worker earnings by potentially thousands of dollars annually for workers who regularly work irregular hours. Under a two-week averaging system, a worker who works 50 hours in week one and 30 hours in week two would receive no overtime pay at all — even though she worked 50 hours in a single workweek, far exceeding the statutory 40-hour threshold. The proposal's operational effect is to eliminate overtime pay for the tens of millions of workers whose schedules fluctuate week to week.

**Compensatory Time as a Substitute for Cash Overtime**: Project 2025 advocates allowing private-sector employers to offer compensatory time off in lieu of cash overtime pay, a practice currently legal only for state and local government employers under 29 U.S.C. § 207(o). This proposal would enable employers to defer overtime compensation indefinitely and create the conditions under which workers may be pressured to accept comp time rather than legally owed cash.

**The Specific Language**: Project 2025 explicitly states that the Department of Labor should **"return to the Trump-era salary threshold"** and **"allow employers to calculate overtime over a two-week period"** *(Project 2025, p. 593)*. These are not speculative proposals — they are operational directives written by former DOL officials who implemented predecessor versions of these policies during the first Trump administration.

**Scale of Workers Affected**: The Economic Policy Institute estimated that restoring the overtime threshold to $58,656 would have extended overtime eligibility to approximately 4.3 million additional salaried workers who had previously been required to work unlimited hours without overtime compensation. Managers, supervisors, and professionals earning between $35,568 and $58,656 annually are disproportionately women and workers of color in low-wage sectors. The rollback of the overtime rule represents a direct income transfer from these workers to their employers — wealth extracted through legal architecture rather than market transactions.

### The Gutting of OSHA Enforcement

**What Project 2025 Did:**

**Exemptions for Small Businesses and First-Time Violators**: Project 2025 proposes exempting small businesses and first-time, non-willful violators from OSHA fines. This proposal would eliminate the deterrent effect of OSHA penalties for the majority of American workplaces. As of 2023, there were 5,283 fatal work injuries in the United States, and approximately 2.5 million non-fatal injury and illness cases were reported in private industry in 2024. OSHA's maximum penalty for a serious violation is $16,131 per violation — already insufficient. Project 2025 would reduce this further to zero for most employers.

**Narrowing Inspection Priorities**: The Project 2025 blueprint directs OSHA to focus safety inspections only on **"egregious offenders"** and to eliminate inspections of businesses that self-certify compliance. This approach would functionally eliminate proactive inspection for the vast majority of American workplaces. OSHA currently has approximately 1,800 federal and state inspectors covering 11 million workplaces — a ratio of approximately one inspector per 6,000 workplaces even at full staffing. The Trump administration's proposed FY 2026 budget would cut OSHA's enforcement staff from 1,292 to 1,124, a 13 percent reduction, and would eliminate approximately 223 inspector positions.

**Rollback of OSHA Rulemaking**: Project 2025 calls for rescinding OSHA's ability to issue emergency temporary standards without formal notice-and-comment rulemaking, directly targeting the mechanism used to protect healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also calls for rescinding recently issued and pending OSHA rules on heat exposure, silica dust, and workplace violence in healthcare settings.

**NIOSH Decimation**: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which conducts the scientific research underlying OSHA standards, had its staff reduced from approximately 1,400 employees to fewer than 150 employees in 2025 under the Trump administration's implementation of the Project 2025 agenda. This represents a greater than 89 percent reduction in the agency's research capacity.

**Enforcement Collapse Under Project 2025 Implementation**: Since the Trump administration began implementing Project 2025's agenda in January 2025, federal wage and hour enforcement and OSHA combined have collected only $130 million in penalties — a 66 percent drop compared to prior years. Workplace safety penalties alone dropped by 47 percent. OSHA also reduced the stated value of a worker's life in its regulatory analysis, directly decreasing the calculated benefit of worker safety rules.

---

### The Suppression of Collective Bargaining and Union Rights

**What Project 2025 Did:**

**Narrowing Section 7 Concerted Activity**: Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. § 157) protects workers' rights to engage in "concerted activities" for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. Project 2025 directs the NLRB to restrict the definition of concerted activity to a narrow set of five rigid scenarios, eliminating protection for the vast majority of workplace organizing activities that fall outside those categories. Workers who engage in what has historically been protected concerted activity outside those five scenarios would be left without recourse when fired by employers for organizing.

**Elimination of Card Check Recognition**: Project 2025 proposes reversing the NLRB's administrative movement toward majority authorization card recognition, requiring all union elections to proceed through employer-supervised, prolonged election processes that give employers maximum opportunity to conduct anti-union campaigns. The NLRB under the Biden administration had moved administratively toward requiring employers to recognize unions that demonstrate majority support through authorization cards, rather than forcing a potentially months-long election process.

**Enabling Captive Audience Meetings**: Project 2025 would eliminate existing constraints on captive audience meetings — mandatory, employer-run sessions where employees are required to attend anti-union presentations under threat of discipline. These meetings are a primary tool of union suppression. The PRO Act would ban captive audience meetings; Project 2025 would enshrine the employer's right to conduct them.

**Joint Employer Rule Reversal**: Project 2025 calls for rescinding the Biden administration's joint employer rule, which held large corporations responsible for the working conditions in their franchised or contracted operations. This rule directly affects the ability of workers at McDonald's, Amazon logistics contractors, and similar franchise/contractor arrangements to hold the ultimate economic actor accountable. Its reversal leaves millions of workers without a legally responsible employer capable of negotiating wages and conditions.

**Decentralization to Anti-Labor States**: Project 2025 proposes allowing states to obtain waivers from federal labor law requirements, including the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act. This decentralization would produce a patchwork of labor standards, effectively allowing hostile states to gut worker protections for workers within their borders while maintaining the form of federal law.

**NLRB Defunding and Restructuring**: Project 2025 targets the NLRB itself for structural weakening, calling for reduced appropriations, elimination of regional offices, and limitations on the General Counsel's prosecutorial discretion. The NLRB's General Counsel position — a political appointee with broad authority to prosecute unfair labor practice cases — was targeted for immediate removal, as occurred in January 2025. The Supreme Court's 2025 decision in Trump v. Wilcox, which held that the President may remove members of multi-member independent agencies at will, directly threatens the NLRB's structural independence. This administration must pursue legislation codifying fixed terms and for-cause removal protection for NLRB Board members and the General Counsel, and must challenge the Wilcox decision's extension through targeted litigation defending the constitutionality of independent agency structures established by Congress.

**Retaliation Against Organizers and Pro-Union Workers**: Project 2025's proposed narrowing of Section 7 protections, combined with the removal of financial penalties for unfair labor practices and the weakening of NLRB enforcement, creates conditions under which employers can fire union supporters with virtual impunity. Current law requires only reinstatement and backpay for illegally fired workers — minus any interim earnings. For a worker who was earning $30,000 annually and spent two years fighting an illegal discharge while earning $25,000 at another job, the total employer liability may be $10,000 or less. Under these conditions, firing union leaders during an organizing campaign is economically rational for employers. The PRO Act's personal liability provision for corporate officers and its enhanced financial penalties are essential deterrents.

---

### The Promotion of Worker Misclassification

**What Project 2025 Did:**

**Rescission of the Independent Contractor Rule**: The Biden administration's January 2024 final rule under the FLSA (29 C.F.R. Part 795) established a multi-factor "economic reality" test for determining worker classification, making it more difficult for employers to misclassify employees as independent contractors. Project 2025 called for rescinding this rule, and the Trump administration stopped enforcing it in 2025, reinstating a more employer-friendly Trump-era guidance that allows platforms like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and similar companies to classify their workers as independent contractors regardless of economic reality.

**Gig Platform Exemptions**: Project 2025 embraces the gig economy misclassification model as a template for labor market flexibility, framing systematic misclassification as a worker preference rather than an employer strategy to eliminate obligations to workers. Workers misclassified as independent contractors lose minimum wage protections, overtime protections, unemployment insurance eligibility, workers' compensation coverage, the right to organize under the NLRA, and anti-discrimination protections under Title VII and related statutes.

**Scale of the Problem**: Approximately 59 million Americans engage in freelance or gig work, and a significant share of these workers are misclassified. In low-wage sectors where misclassification is most prevalent — construction, delivery, domestic services — misclassified workers earn approximately 25 to 33 percent less than employees doing equivalent work. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that misclassification costs the federal government billions annually in lost payroll tax revenue, while denying workers billions more in lost benefits and protections. The Treasury Department has estimated that worker misclassification costs the federal government approximately $8 billion in lost tax revenue annually — money that employers retain by shifting the tax burden to workers who, classified as "self-employed," owe both the employee and employer shares of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes.

**California's ABC Test and the National Standard**: California's Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), enacted in 2019, established the "ABC test" for worker classification: a worker is presumed to be an employee unless the employer can demonstrate that (A) the worker is free from the employer's control and direction in performing work, (B) the work is outside the usual course of the employer's business, and (C) the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade or occupation. This is the most protective classification standard in any U.S. jurisdiction. The federal economic reality test falls short of this standard. This administration will pursue legislation codifying a version of the ABC test in the FLSA, the NLRA, and the OSH Act — ensuring that worker classification is determined by economic reality across all federal labor laws simultaneously.

### The Privatization of Apprenticeship Training

**What Project 2025 Did:**

**Reviving Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs)**: The Trump administration's first term created the Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Program (IRAP) system, which allowed corporations and industry associations to establish their own apprenticeship programs outside the oversight of the Department of Labor's Registered Apprenticeship framework. IRAPs exempted participating employers from the Registered Apprenticeship program's requirements, including stepwise wage increases, prevailing wage requirements, equal opportunity employment standards, and the quality oversight exercised by joint labor-management apprenticeship committees. The Biden administration immediately rescinded IRAPs in 2021. Project 2025 calls for their revival and expansion.

**Undermining the Registered Apprenticeship System**: The Registered Apprenticeship system, governed by the National Apprenticeship Act (29 U.S.C. § 50 et seq.), has produced the highest-quality skilled trade workers in the country through joint labor-management programs that deliver wages, safety training, and credential portability. IRAPs would create a parallel, employer-controlled system with lower standards — allowing corporations to claim the reputational benefit of apprenticeship programs while eliminating the worker protections that make those programs valuable.

**Union-Busting Through Training Policy**: Because Registered Apprenticeship programs are primarily operated by unions and joint labor-management committees in industries like construction, electrical work, and manufacturing, the substitution of IRAPs for Registered Apprenticeships is also a union-busting strategy. Employers that adopt IRAPs can recruit workers directly into employer-controlled training pipelines, bypassing union hiring halls entirely and severing the connection between skill credential and union membership.

---

### The Deconstruction of Worker Training and Workforce Development

**What Project 2025 Did:**

**Defunding the Employment and Training Administration**: The Employment and Training Administration administers the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I programs — adult, dislocated worker, and youth employment programs — serving approximately 7 million participants annually. These programs provide job training, career counseling, and employment services for workers displaced by economic changes, industry shifts, and technological disruption. Project 2025 calls for consolidating and reducing federal workforce development programs, transferring authority to states with fewer requirements and less federal investment.

**Privatizing Job Corps**: Job Corps, operated by ETA, is the federal government's largest residential education and job training program for economically disadvantaged young people aged 16 to 24. Approximately 34,000 students participate annually in 120 Job Corps centers across the country, receiving vocational training, GED preparation, and job placement services. Project 2025 calls for privatizing Job Corps operations, shifting from a federally operated model to a contractor model that prioritizes cost reduction over outcomes. The Trump administration moved in this direction, proposing center closures and management changes that disrupted program delivery.

**Eliminating Pre-Apprenticeship Programs**: Project 2025's hostility to federally structured workforce pathways extends to pre-apprenticeship programs, which prepare workers — disproportionately women, workers of color, and workers without prior industry connections — for entry into Registered Apprenticeship programs and other technical career paths. The elimination of these programs removes the on-ramp that allows underrepresented workers to access the best-paying skilled trade positions.

**Undermining Labor Market Data Collection**: The Bureau of Labor Statistics serves as the empirical foundation for all labor policy. Project 2025's broader campaign against federal data collection — which includes proposals to reduce Census Bureau operations and eliminate federal surveys — would impair BLS's ability to collect the unemployment, wage, and occupational injury data that informs labor regulation, collective bargaining, and economic policy. A government that cannot measure labor market conditions cannot regulate them effectively.

### The Human Cost

The aggregate human cost of Project 2025's labor agenda, in its proposed and partially implemented form, is measurable:

**Wage Theft**: Employers steal approximately $50 billion from American workers annually through minimum wage violations, overtime theft, off-the-clock work requirements, illegal deductions, and tip theft. This figure surpasses all robberies, burglaries, and motor vehicle thefts combined. In the 10 most populous states alone, 2.4 million workers lose $8 billion annually to minimum wage violations alone. Project 2025's enforcement rollbacks would accelerate this theft.

**Workplace Deaths and Injuries**: 5,283 workers were killed on the job in 2023. Thousands more die annually from occupational diseases, including approximately 50,000 workers who die each year from occupational illnesses like silicosis, mesothelioma, and occupational cancers — diseases that OSHA standards are designed to prevent. OSHA's decimated budget and Project 2025's enforcement restrictions directly cost lives.

**Union Suppression**: Union membership has declined from 35 percent in the 1950s to 9.9 percent in 2024. Research consistently demonstrates that union membership raises wages by approximately 10 to 15 percent, provides access to employer-sponsored health insurance and retirement benefits, and reduces workplace injuries. The Economic Policy Institute has documented that declining union membership accounts for approximately one-third of the increase in wage inequality since the 1970s.

**Paid Leave Deprivation**: Only 27 percent of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave. Among the lowest-wage workers, fewer than 5 percent have this access. Without federal paid leave, workers who take unpaid leave under FMLA risk financial ruin; many do not take leave at all, returning to work before they or their family members have recovered. The United States remains one of the only developed nations without a federal paid family and medical leave program.

**Misclassification Losses**: Workers misclassified as independent contractors in transportation earn approximately 25 percent less than their employee equivalents. Full-time misclassified workers in low-wage industries in New York State earned roughly two-thirds of what employee counterparts earned. Nationally, misclassification removes millions of workers from the labor law protections that prevent these disparities.

**The Racial and Gender Dimensions**: Labor law violations disproportionately harm workers of color and women workers. The industries with the highest rates of wage theft — agriculture, domestic service, restaurant, garment manufacturing — employ disproportionate numbers of Black, Latino, Asian, and immigrant workers. Women workers are over-represented in tipped occupations, in domestic service, and in care work — all sectors where wage theft and labor law exclusions are most severe. The industries with the lowest union density — and thus the lowest wages and worst working conditions — are disproportionately composed of women workers and workers of color. The labor agenda of this administration is therefore simultaneously a racial equity and gender equity agenda: there is no path to closing racial and gender wealth and income gaps without enforcing labor law and strengthening worker power.

**Child Labor Harms**: The documented resurgence of illegal child labor in the United States — in food processing, manufacturing, and construction — represents an acute moral and legal failure. Children found working in slaughterhouses and on factory floors late at night are not there by choice. They are there because enforcement has been inadequate, because trafficking and labor exploitation of unaccompanied migrant children went unmonitored, and because some employers face insufficient penalties to deter violations. Project 2025's enforcement rollbacks guarantee more of the same.

**Workforce Development Deprivation**: Workers who lose jobs due to technological change, industry relocation, or economic downturns require retraining and support. The defunding of WIOA programs, Job Corps, and pre-apprenticeship programs removes the primary federal mechanism for helping displaced workers find new employment at decent wages. The consequence is not simply individual unemployment — it is the long-term economic marginalization of communities whose primary industries have declined, from coal country to manufacturing towns to agricultural regions experiencing automation.

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

The federal government's authority to regulate labor conditions derives from multiple constitutional sources:

**Commerce Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3)**: The Supreme Court has consistently upheld federal labor legislation as a valid exercise of Commerce Clause power since NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1 (1937), which established that Congress may regulate labor conditions that substantially affect interstate commerce. This foundational authority supports the FLSA, NLRA, OSH Act, ERISA, and FMLA.

**Necessary and Proper Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18)**: Enforcement mechanisms, administrative agencies, and institutional structures for labor law implementation find constitutional grounding in the Necessary and Proper Clause, which authorizes Congress to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution its enumerated powers.

**Spending Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1)**: Federal grant conditions attached to workforce development funding — including conditions requiring state compliance with apprenticeship standards, prevailing wage requirements, and anti-discrimination mandates — are grounded in the Spending Clause authority upheld in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).

**Due Process Clause (U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1)**: Procedural protections for workers in administrative proceedings, including NLRB unfair labor practice hearings and OSHA enforcement actions, find grounding in the Due Process Clause's requirement that government deprive no person of liberty or property without due process of law.

**First Amendment (U.S. Const. amend. I)**: Workers' rights to concerted activity include expressive activity — leafleting, picketing, public communications about working conditions. The First Amendment protects these activities against government interference. Employer coercion of worker speech — through threats of discharge for union organizing, mandatory anti-union meetings, surveillance of organizing activity — must be balanced against the First Amendment rights of workers to communicate freely about their wages, working conditions, and collective organizing. This administration will defend an expansive interpretation of worker expressive rights, including in the context of social media and digital organizing.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.)**: Enacted in 1938, the FLSA establishes the federal minimum wage, overtime requirements (time-and-a-half for hours beyond 40 per week), recordkeeping requirements, and child labor restrictions. The FLSA covers approximately 135 million workers and is administered by the Wage and Hour Division.

**National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq.)**: Enacted in 1935, the NLRA guarantees workers' rights to self-organization, collective bargaining, and concerted activity. Section 7 (29 U.S.C. § 157) enumerates these rights; Section 8 (29 U.S.C. § 158) defines employer and union unfair labor practices. The NLRB administers the Act.

**Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. § 651 et seq.)**: Enacted in 1970, the OSH Act establishes the employer's general duty to provide employment free from recognized hazards (29 U.S.C. § 654), authorizes OSHA to issue safety and health standards, and provides for inspection, citation, and penalty. OSHA's maximum penalties for serious violations are capped by statute and have not kept pace with inflation.

**Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. § 3141 et seq.)**: Enacted in 1931, Davis-Bacon requires contractors on federally funded construction projects to pay locally prevailing wages and benefits. It covers approximately $217 billion in federal construction contracts annually and prevents federal spending from being used to undercut local wage standards.

**Service Contract Act (41 U.S.C. § 6701 et seq.)**: Requires contractors providing services to the federal government to pay prevailing wages and benefits, covering millions of workers in food service, janitorial, security, and other federal contracting industries.

**Employee Retirement Income Security Act (29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.)**: ERISA governs private-sector pension and health benefit plans, establishing minimum standards for plan management, participant protections, and fiduciary duties. EBSA administers ERISA and oversees approximately $10 trillion in pension assets.

**Family and Medical Leave Act (29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.)**: Enacted in 1993, FMLA guarantees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying family and medical reasons. It covers employers with 50 or more employees, leaving approximately 40 percent of private-sector workers without FMLA coverage. It provides no wage replacement.

**National Apprenticeship Act (29 U.S.C. § 50 et seq.)**: Enacted in 1937, the Act grants the Secretary of Labor authority to formulate standards for apprenticeship programs. Registered Apprenticeship programs operating under DOL standards serve approximately 590,000 active apprentices in more than 27,000 programs nationally.

**Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.)**: MSPA governs the working conditions of migrant and seasonal agricultural workers, requiring that farm labor contractors be registered, that workers be provided accurate disclosures of wages and working conditions, and that housing and transportation provided by agricultural employers or labor contractors meet federal safety standards. WHD administers MSPA, but enforcement has been historically under-resourced relative to the scope of violations, particularly in multi-layered contractor structures.

**Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act (41 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.)**: Requires federal contractors manufacturing goods to pay minimum wages established by the Secretary of Labor for the industry and locality, and to comply with overtime, child labor, and workplace safety requirements. While the Service Contract Act and Davis-Bacon Act address services and construction, Walsh-Healey covers manufacturing contracts — an increasingly important category as federal industrial policy directs procurement toward domestically manufactured clean energy equipment, semiconductors, and defense materiel.

**Portal-to-Portal Act (29 U.S.C. § 251 et seq.)**: Addresses the compensability of time spent traveling to and from the workplace and engaging in pre- and post-shift activities. As employers increasingly require workers to clear security screenings, attend pre-shift briefings, and travel between work sites, the scope of compensable time under the Portal-to-Portal Act and FLSA is an active enforcement and litigation area. Direct WHD to issue updated guidance on the compensability of time spent in employer-required activities including security screening, COVID-related health checks, and pre-shift digital clock-in procedures.

### Key Case Law

**NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1 (1937)**: Upheld the NLRA as a constitutional exercise of Commerce Clause authority, establishing the constitutional foundation for all subsequent federal labor legislation.

**United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100 (1941)**: Upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act, explicitly overruling the pre-New Deal interpretation that manufacturing fell outside Congress's commerce power and establishing that Congress may regulate the conditions of labor in industries affecting interstate commerce.

**Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 584 U.S. 79 (2018)**: Held that FLSA exemptions should be given a fair reading rather than construed narrowly against employers, a decision that this administration must account for in overtime rulemaking by ensuring the statutory basis for coverage rules is clearly established.

**Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. 497 (2018)**: Upheld mandatory arbitration agreements with class action waivers in employment contracts, a decision that has facilitated the suppression of wage theft claims. This administration must pursue legislative reversal through the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act.

**Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, 594 U.S. 139 (2021)**: Struck down a California regulation allowing union organizers access to agricultural employer property, a decision requiring this administration to develop alternative organizing access strategies consistent with constitutional property rights doctrine.

**Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024)**: Overruled *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council*, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), eliminating the doctrine under which courts deferred to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. This ruling requires the Department of Labor to ground all major rulemaking — overtime thresholds, independent contractor classification, workplace safety standards — in the clearest possible statutory language, and requires the Solicitor of Labor to develop litigation strategies that do not rely on *Chevron* deference. It also underscores the importance of pursuing legislative codification of key labor standards that were previously achievable through administrative action alone.

**Trump v. Wilcox (2025)**: The Supreme Court's ruling that the President may remove members of independent multi-member agencies at will directly threatens the NLRB's institutional independence. This administration must pursue legislation explicitly codifying fixed-term, for-cause removal protection for NLRB Board members, while simultaneously pursuing constitutional litigation challenging the Court's reasoning as applied to agencies with adjudicative functions. The NLRB's legitimacy as a quasi-judicial body depends on its insulation from direct presidential control over individual decisions.

### The Labor Law Preemption Landscape

Federal labor law preempts a wide range of state and local action through two distinct doctrines: Garmon preemption (which preempts state and local regulation of conduct that is either protected or prohibited by the NLRA, as established in *San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon*, 359 U.S. 236 (1959)) and Machinists preemption (which preempts state regulation of areas that Congress intended to leave to free market forces, as established in *Lodge 76, International Association of Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission*, 427 U.S. 132 (1976)).

These preemption doctrines have been used by employers to block state and local worker protection legislation that goes beyond federal minimums. This administration, through the Solicitor of Labor, will take a narrow view of NLRA preemption in enforcement litigation, declining to assert preemption as a basis for invalidating state and local worker protection laws that supplement (rather than contradict) federal labor standards. Pursue legislation through the PRO Act to explicitly authorize states to enact labor protections that exceed federal minimums without preemption.

## Part III: Comprehensive Labor Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: Wages — Restoring and Advancing the Floor

#### Federal Minimum Wage: $17 per Hour

The federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has not been raised since 2009 — the longest period without an increase in the FLSA's 86-year history. In real (inflation-adjusted) terms, the federal minimum wage is at its lowest point since 1956. Issue an executive directive to the Secretary of Labor to convene an emergency rulemaking proceeding, and pursue immediate legislative action to raise the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour, phased in over three years, with annual automatic adjustments thereafter indexed to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) under 29 U.S.C. § 206.

Tip credit abuse, under which tipped workers in many states are paid $2.13 per hour with the expectation that tips will bring them to the minimum wage, must be ended. Pursue legislative elimination of the federal tipped minimum wage, requiring full minimum wage payment before tips.

#### Restoring the Overtime Salary Threshold

Issue an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Labor to immediately reinstate the Biden-era overtime salary threshold of $58,656 under 29 C.F.R. Part 541, using the full regulatory authority granted to the Secretary under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) to define and delimit the executive, administrative, and professional exemptions. Simultaneously, pursue legislation to explicitly codify salary threshold indexing in the FLSA, removing the threshold from the biennial appropriations and rulemaking cycle and making it automatic.

Reject all proposals for biweekly or multi-week overtime averaging. The 40-hour workweek is the statutory standard under 29 U.S.C. § 207 and will be enforced as written.

#### Prevailing Wage Enforcement and Expansion

Strengthen Davis-Bacon Act enforcement by directing WHD to audit all federally funded construction contracts for prevailing wage compliance within 90 days of the Secretary's confirmation. Issue regulations expanding Davis-Bacon coverage to federally assisted projects receiving significant federal financial assistance, including projects funded through infrastructure programs, broadband deployment, and clean energy tax credits. Modernize prevailing wage surveys to ensure that wage determinations reflect current market conditions in each locality.

The Trump administration's February 2025 executive order attacking diversity, equity, and inclusion in federal contracting also targeted wage equity requirements for federal contractors. This administration will fully restore and strengthen the OFCCP's equal pay enforcement, including through reinstatement of pay equity audits and restoration of compensation data collection requirements for all federal contractors.

#### Service Contract Act and Federal Contractor Standards

The Service Contract Act (41 U.S.C. § 6701 et seq.) requires federal service contractors to pay prevailing wages and benefits to their workers. Approximately 2 million workers — in food services, janitorial, security, healthcare support, and other service categories — are covered by SCA wage determinations. The Trump administration has weakened SCA enforcement and revised prevailing wage methodologies to reduce wage determinations.

Issue an Executive Order directing WHD to immediately review all existing SCA wage determinations and update them to reflect current local prevailing wages within 180 days. Direct the Secretary to expand SCA coverage by issuing regulations covering contractors that provide IT and professional services to the federal government where those services are performed primarily at federal facilities.

#### Raising the Minimum Wage for Federal Contractors

Executive Order 14026, issued by President Biden in April 2021, raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, effective January 30, 2022, and provided for annual adjustments. The Trump administration rescinded this order. Issue an Executive Order on Day One reinstating the $15 minimum for federal contractors and raising it to $17 per hour within one year to be consistent with the legislative minimum wage target, with annual CPI indexing thereafter.

---

### Reform II: Workplace Safety — Rebuilding OSHA

#### Full OSHA Funding and Mandatory Staffing

Issue an Executive Order directing the Office of Management and Budget to submit a supplemental appropriations request in the first budget cycle that brings OSHA's enforcement staffing to one inspector per 2,500 workplaces — from the current ratio of approximately one per 6,000. This is not aspirational. Every year that OSHA operates with inspection staffing below the ratio necessary to conduct meaningful enforcement, employers who violate safety standards face no realistic prospect of detection.

Immediately reverse the Trump administration's budget cuts to OSHA, restoring the enforcement staff eliminated in 2025 and reinstating the 223 inspector positions cut in the proposed FY 2026 budget. Direct the Secretary to prioritize hiring inspectors in high-hazard industries: construction, manufacturing, meatpacking, agriculture, and warehousing.

#### NIOSH Restoration

Immediately rebuild NIOSH from its decimated state of fewer than 150 employees to its full operational complement of approximately 1,400 scientists and researchers. NIOSH's research directly underlies OSHA standard-setting; without it, OSHA cannot develop or defend science-based safety rules. Pursue emergency supplemental appropriations for NIOSH reconstitution.

#### Criminal Referrals for Willful Violations

The OSH Act provides for criminal penalties for willful violations that cause the death of an employee, but the maximum criminal penalty is six months imprisonment — a misdemeanor. Direct the Secretary of Labor to establish a formal protocol for referring willful fatal violations to the Department of Justice for prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 1112 (involuntary manslaughter) and state criminal statutes where applicable. Pursue legislation to upgrade willful fatal OSH Act violations to felonies under 29 U.S.C. § 666.

#### Heat, Silica, and Workplace Violence Standards

Immediately finalize the pending OSHA heat standard, which would establish enforceable requirements for drinking water, shade, rest breaks, and acclimatization plans for workers in hot environments. Finalize the OSHA workplace violence standard for healthcare and social assistance workers. Strengthen the existing silica standard (29 C.F.R. § 1910.1053 and § 1926.1153) through enforcement guidance that treats crystalline silica exposure in engineered stone fabrication as a priority target for inspection and citation.

#### Expanded OSHA Penalty Authority

OSHA's maximum penalty for a willful violation is $161,323 per instance — an amount that large corporations treat as a routine cost of doing business. For a company with billions in annual revenue, even the maximum OSHA penalty is not a deterrent. Pursue legislation to remove the statutory cap on OSHA willful violation penalties and replace it with a formula tied to employer revenue: willful violations that cause worker death shall carry a minimum penalty of $1 million for employers with revenues exceeding $10 million. Director the Secretary to increase routine serious violation penalties to the statutory maximum for all violations in high-hazard industries.

OSHA's current enforcement structure also allows employers to contest citations through a multi-year administrative and judicial process, during which hazardous conditions often remain unabated. Pursue legislation to require employers to abate all cited hazards within 30 days of citation regardless of whether a contest has been filed, with an administrative stay available only upon employer demonstration of good cause.

#### Federal Safety Net for Agricultural Workers

Agricultural workers are among the most dangerous occupational categories in the United States. Approximately 374 agricultural workers died in work-related accidents in 2022. Yet the OSH Act explicitly excludes farms with fewer than 11 employees from OSHA inspection and citation authority under the annual appropriations rider that has appeared in OSHA's budget since 1977. Pursue legislation to eliminate this appropriations rider and bring all agricultural employers within OSHA's jurisdiction. Direct OSHA, in the interim, to use all available authority including the General Duty Clause (29 U.S.C. § 654(a)(1)) to protect agricultural workers on farms not covered by the exemption.

---

### Reform III: The Right to Organize — PRO Act and NLRB Restoration

#### Pass the PRO Act

The Protecting the Right to Organize Act is the most significant proposed reform to federal labor law since the NLRA was enacted in 1935. Its passage is a legislative priority of this administration. The PRO Act's key provisions:

**Banning Captive Audience Meetings**: Employers may not require employees to attend meetings where the employer communicates opposition to union organizing. Workers retain the right to attend such meetings voluntarily. Employers who conduct mandatory captive audience meetings commit an unfair labor practice.

**Card Check Recognition**: When a majority of employees in a bargaining unit sign authorization cards designating a union as their representative, the employer must recognize the union unless it promptly files a petition for a Board-supervised election. This eliminates the current system under which employers routinely delay and subvert elections that workers have already won through card majorities.

**Financial Penalties for Unfair Labor Practices**: The PRO Act imposes civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation (and up to $100,000 for willful or repeat violations) for unfair labor practices, replacing the current system under which the primary remedy for employer misconduct is a cease-and-desist order.

**Elimination of Right-to-Work Loophole**: The PRO Act repeals Section 14(b) of the NLRA (29 U.S.C. § 164(b)), which allows states to pass right-to-work laws prohibiting union security agreements. This restores the national standard and eliminates the patchwork of anti-union state laws that have weakened unions in more than 27 states.

**Broader Employee Definition**: The PRO Act narrows the ability of employers to classify workers as supervisors or independent contractors for purposes of NLRA exclusion, bringing millions of misclassified workers within the Act's protection.

#### NLRB Restoration and Funding

The NLRB has been chronically underfunded. Immediately appoint a full five-member Board with pro-worker majorities and confirm a General Counsel with a demonstrated record of aggressive unfair labor practice prosecution. Pursue legislation to substantially increase NLRB appropriations, restoring regional offices closed under prior administrations, and expanding staff to process the backlog of unfair labor practice charges that has grown under years of understaffing.

Direct the General Counsel to reverse Trump-era NLRB general counsel memoranda that narrowed Section 7 protections, restricted the use of remedies like make-whole relief, and weakened the NLRB's ability to seek injunctive relief under Section 10(j) (29 U.S.C. § 160(j)) pending resolution of unfair labor practice cases.

#### Sectoral Bargaining Pilots

Direct the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the NLRB General Counsel and the Assistant Secretary for Policy, to establish an interagency working group on sectoral bargaining within 180 days. The working group shall develop pilot program proposals for sectoral wage and standards boards in two to three high-density industries — fast food, domestic care, and warehousing are priority candidates — where the enterprise bargaining model has proven incapable of achieving meaningful worker voice. These pilots shall be designed to gather data on wage outcomes, turnover, and safety compliance in covered versus non-covered establishments, generating the evidentiary record necessary to support legislation.

#### Restoring Make-Whole Remedies

For decades, the primary remedy available to workers who win unfair labor practice cases before the NLRB was a cease-and-desist order and reinstatement. Backpay was available but often reduced by interim earnings, and punitive remedies were unavailable. The Biden-era NLRB General Counsel had begun applying a "make-whole" remedy standard — requiring employers to compensate workers for all direct and foreseeable financial harms caused by unfair labor practices, including search-for-work and interim employment expenses, excess tax liability from receiving backpay as a lump sum, and compensation for loss of benefits.

Direct the new General Counsel to immediately reinstate this make-whole remedy standard and apply it in all pending and future unfair labor practice cases. Pursue legislation through the PRO Act to codify the make-whole standard in 29 U.S.C. § 160(c), ensuring it cannot be reversed by a future NLRB General Counsel.

#### Protection for Workers in the First Contract

The most dangerous period for a newly recognized union is the window between certification and the ratification of a first contract. Employers who have lost a union election frequently drag out first contract negotiations for years, hoping workers' commitment to the union erodes. The PRO Act addresses this by requiring binding first contract arbitration if the parties cannot reach agreement within 90 days of the union's certification. This administration will pursue this provision as a legislative priority and, pending its enactment, direct the NLRB General Counsel to use the full range of available 10(j) injunctive relief authority against employers who bargain in bad faith during first contract negotiations.

---

### Reform IV: Independent Contractor Classification and Gig Worker Protections

#### Restore and Strengthen the Economic Reality Test

Issue an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Labor to immediately reinstate the Biden administration's independent contractor final rule (29 C.F.R. Part 795) and designate it a priority for legal defense in any litigation. Direct the WHD to issue formal guidance clarifying that virtual marketplace companies whose platforms determine the scope, terms, and conditions of worker-customer interactions are employers under the FLSA, not referral services.

Pursue legislation to codify the economic reality test in the FLSA statute itself, removing it from the rulemaking cycle and making it far harder for subsequent administrations to reverse. The codified test must consider: the worker's opportunity for profit or loss depending on managerial skill; the relative investments of the potential employer and worker; the degree of permanence of the work relationship; the nature and degree of control by the potential employer; whether the work is integral to the employer's business; and the skill and initiative of the worker.

#### Portable Benefits for Gig Workers

Direct the Secretary to establish a task force, in consultation with state labor commissioners and worker advocacy organizations, to design a portable benefits system for workers who do not have a single stable employer relationship. Portable benefits would follow the worker rather than the job, pooling contributions from multiple engagements to provide access to health insurance, retirement savings, workers' compensation, and paid leave. Present a legislative proposal to Congress within one year.

#### Algorithmic Accountability in Platform Employment

Direct the WHD and NLRB, acting jointly, to issue guidance establishing that algorithmic management of worker schedules, assignments, routing, and pay constitutes the exercise of employer control for purposes of both FLSA employee status and NLRA jurisdiction. Pursue rulemaking requiring platform employers above a specified revenue threshold to provide workers with access to the algorithms that determine their compensation, assignment priority, and account deactivation.

---

### Reform V: Wage Theft Enforcement and Prosecution

#### Wage Theft Is a Federal Crime — Prosecute It As Such

The WHD recovers hundreds of millions in stolen wages annually, but the criminal enforcement component of the FLSA has been chronically underutilized. Repeated wage theft — the employer who steals wages, settles with DOL, and returns to stealing wages — is a willful criminal act under 29 U.S.C. § 216(a), punishable by imprisonment. Direct the Secretary to establish a standing protocol requiring WHD to refer all cases involving willful repeat violations to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. End the practice of allowing wage thieves to return to normal business by paying back amounts owed with no additional consequence.

#### Expanded WHD Staffing and Authority

The Wage and Hour Division recovered $273 million for workers in FY 2024. This is a fraction of the estimated $50 billion stolen annually. Pursue legislation to double WHD appropriations within four years, with a specific mandate to hire investigators in industries with demonstrated patterns of wage theft: agriculture, domestic services, construction subcontracting, restaurant and hospitality, and garment manufacturing.

Pursue legislation to amend 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) to establish a private right of action with enhanced liquidated damages (double the amount of wages owed, rather than the current default of one times wages owed) and to eliminate mandatory arbitration agreements as a bar to wage theft claims in federal court.

#### Hot Goods Provision Enforcement

The FLSA's "hot goods" provision (29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(1)) prohibits the shipment in interstate commerce of goods produced in violation of the FLSA's wage and hour requirements. Direct the Secretary to aggressively use this provision against supply chains in which subcontractors systematically steal wages from production workers, making the lead contractor responsible for ensuring FLSA compliance throughout its supply chain. This tool, used aggressively, transforms wage theft from a contractor-level problem to a supply chain liability that large corporations must actively prevent.

#### Priority Industries for WHD Enforcement

The Wage and Hour Division shall designate the following industries as enforcement priority targets based on documented rates of violation and worker vulnerability:

**Agricultural and Food Processing**: Farmworkers and meatpacking plant workers face some of the highest rates of minimum wage, overtime, and child labor violations. Many are recruited through labor intermediaries — contractors and farm labor contractors — who can be held jointly liable with the ultimate employer. Direct WHD to deploy enforcement resources specifically targeting agricultural labor contractors under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.) and the FLSA.

**Domestic Service and Care Work**: Home care aides, housecleaners, and childcare workers — the workforce that makes all other work possible — face extraordinary rates of wage theft. The 2013 Home Care Final Rule bringing home care workers within FLSA coverage must be fully enforced. Direct WHD to develop a targeted enforcement initiative for domestic service employers, including a complaint intake process accessible to undocumented workers who fear retaliation.

**Restaurant and Hospitality**: Tipped workers face systematic wage theft through tip theft, tip pool manipulation, illegal deductions, and off-the-clock work requirements. Direct WHD to reinstate the "80/20 rule" guidance under 29 C.F.R. § 531.56 — limiting the amount of non-tipped work that a tipped employee can perform while being paid the tipped minimum wage — and to prioritize enforcement of tip credit requirements in multi-unit restaurant chains.

**Construction Subcontracting**: Wage theft is endemic in construction subcontracting chains, where project developers insulate themselves from liability by contracting to general contractors who subcontract to specialty contractors who hire day laborers. Direct WHD to apply joint employer doctrine aggressively to construction project chains, and pursue legislation clarifying that project developers bear joint employer responsibility for FLSA compliance in their construction supply chains.

---

### Reform VI: Paid Family and Medical Leave

#### Pass the FAMILY Act

The Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act (FAMILY Act) creates a national paid family and medical leave insurance program administered through the Social Security Administration. Workers would contribute a small fraction of payroll — approximately 0.2 percent from employees and 0.2 percent from employers — to fund 12 weeks of paid leave at approximately 66 percent of wages for qualifying family and medical reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, care for a seriously ill family member, a worker's own serious illness, and circumstances arising from a family member's military deployment.

The FAMILY Act covers all workers — including part-time workers, self-employed workers, and workers in small businesses — addressing the critical coverage gap in the current FMLA framework. Only 27 percent of private-sector workers currently have access to any paid family leave from their employers. Among the lowest-wage workers, fewer than 5 percent have this access.

#### Expand FMLA Coverage as a Bridge Measure

While pursuing federal paid leave legislation, issue an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Labor to propose a rule expanding FMLA coverage to employers with 25 or more employees (from the current threshold of 50), effective within 90 days of the Secretary's confirmation. This expansion would cover millions of additional workers at small businesses who are currently excluded from even unpaid leave protections.

Pursue a regulatory expansion of qualifying FMLA reasons to include bereavement leave, leave related to domestic violence and sexual assault, and expanded coverage for mental health conditions as serious health conditions under 29 U.S.C. § 2612.

#### International Context and the Failure of American Exceptionalism on Leave

Every other member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) — every comparable developed nation — provides paid family leave as a matter of federal law. The United States stands alone in its refusal to guarantee this basic protection. The international evidence on paid leave is unequivocal: countries with paid leave have higher maternal labor force participation rates, better infant health outcomes, reduced rates of postpartum depression, and stronger long-term economic participation by women. The California, New York, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, Colorado, and Maryland paid leave programs provide a domestic evidence base that confirms these findings. Federal paid leave is not an untested experiment — it is a structural catch-up with the rest of the developed world.

The FAMILY Act's 12-week benefit would replace approximately 66 percent of wages, capped at the Social Security wage base. This is not generous by international standards — Germany provides up to 14 months of parental leave at 67 percent of wages, and Sweden provides 480 days of parental benefit per child. But it establishes the floor that every American worker deserves, and it does so at a cost — approximately $15 billion per year funded by payroll contributions — that is affordable and justifiable as an investment in worker health, family stability, and long-run economic productivity.

---

### Reform VII: Rebuilding the Registered Apprenticeship System

#### Eliminate IRAPs

Issue an Executive Order on Day One rescinding all executive orders and regulatory actions that established or expanded the Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Program. Direct the Secretary of Labor to publish a final rule terminating the IRAP framework within 60 days. Employers who operated IRAPs must transition workers to Registered Apprenticeship programs or discontinue the programs.

#### Expand Registered Apprenticeship

The United States has approximately 590,000 Registered Apprentices — a fraction of the workforce compared to countries like Germany and the United Kingdom, where apprenticeship is a primary pathway to skilled trade careers. Set a target of 1 million active Registered Apprentices within five years, with a specific mandate to expand apprenticeship programs in industries facing skilled workforce shortages: clean energy installation, healthcare, information technology, and advanced manufacturing.

Pursue legislation to provide federal financial support for apprentice wages during the early phase of apprenticeship programs, reducing the financial barrier to program expansion. Establish competitive grants for joint labor-management apprenticeship committees to develop new programs in high-demand occupations.

#### Prevailing Wage in Apprenticeship Contracts

Direct the Secretary to issue guidance requiring all Registered Apprenticeship programs sponsored by federal contractors to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. § 3141) prevailing wage requirements for journeyworkers in the same classification, with apprentice wage schedules set as a percentage of prevailing wages.

#### Equity in Registered Apprenticeship

Registered Apprenticeship programs have historically underrepresented women, workers of color, and workers without prior industry connections. Women comprise fewer than 10 percent of active Registered Apprentices in most construction trades. Direct the ETA to condition expanded federal apprenticeship grants on demonstrated equal opportunity recruitment plans, mentorship programs for underrepresented workers, and anti-harassment training. Restore OFCCP's authority to audit apprenticeship sponsors for compliance with equal opportunity requirements under 29 C.F.R. Part 30.

Establish a direct pipeline from Job Corps, YouthBuild, and other DOL-funded youth employment programs into Registered Apprenticeship programs in the building trades, healthcare, and information technology. This pipeline must include wage supports for participants transitioning from youth employment into apprenticeship.

---

### Reform VIII: Worker Training, Workforce Development, and the Employment and Training Administration

#### Restore Workforce Development Funding

The Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to the Employment and Training Administration's workforce development programs are part of the Project 2025 agenda to defund federal worker training. Immediately restore funding for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I programs — adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs — that provide job training, career counseling, and employment services to approximately 7 million participants annually.

#### Career Pathways and Sectoral Training

Direct the ETA to prioritize career pathways programs — integrated sequences of education, training, and work experience aligned to industry-recognized credentials in high-demand sectors — over short-term job placement programs that fail to produce lasting wage gains. Establish competitive grants for sector partnerships that bring together employers, community colleges, unions, and worker advocacy organizations to develop training programs with guaranteed job placement at living wages.

**Clean Energy Workforce**: The transition to clean energy — in solar, wind, battery manufacturing, electric vehicle production, and building electrification — will create millions of new jobs. These jobs must be good jobs. Issue an Executive Order directing ETA to develop a Clean Energy Workforce Initiative, establishing training pipelines for workers displaced from fossil fuel industries and new entrants into clean energy occupations, with a mandate that all positions created through federally funded clean energy projects pay prevailing wages and offer Registered Apprenticeship pathways. This initiative shall be developed in coordination with DOE and EPA, ensuring that clean energy transition policy and labor standards policy are aligned.

**Healthcare Workforce**: The United States faces severe shortages in nursing, direct care, behavioral health, and primary care — shortages that are most acute in rural and low-income communities. The causes are multiple, but inadequate wages and working conditions in the healthcare sector — driven in part by the dominance of large hospital systems that have successfully resisted unionization — contribute directly. Direct ETA to establish healthcare career pathway grants specifically targeting Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), and behavioral health technician training, with stipend support for workers who cannot afford to leave employment while training.

**Manufacturing Workforce**: The administration's industrial policy — including the reshoring of semiconductor, pharmaceutical, and clean energy manufacturing — requires a skilled manufacturing workforce. Direct ETA and EDA to coordinate workforce development investments with manufacturing industrial policy, ensuring that federally supported manufacturing facilities are paired with apprenticeship and training programs that prepare workers for the specific skills those facilities require.

#### Reentry Employment Programs

Expand federal investment in reentry employment programs under WIOA and the Second Chance Act, which support individuals with criminal records in accessing employment and training. Coordinate with the Department of Justice on eliminating blanket criminal background check requirements from federal contractor hiring, consistent with the EEOC's existing guidance on individualized assessment under Title VII.

#### Unemployment Insurance Modernization

The federal-state unemployment insurance (UI) system — governed by Title III of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 501 et seq.) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (26 U.S.C. § 3301 et seq.) — has not been substantially modernized since the 1970s. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed catastrophic failures in state UI systems: outdated information technology, 19th-century eligibility rules that exclude gig workers and part-time workers, and benefit levels set so low that they provide no meaningful income support.

Direct the Secretary of Labor to establish a UI Modernization Initiative providing grants and technical assistance to states for technology upgrades, expanding coverage to part-time workers who have lost hours, and ensuring that UI benefit levels reach at least 50 percent of a worker's prior wages. Pursue legislation establishing federal minimum UI benefit standards, replacing the current system in which some states provide inadequate benefits designed more to force rapid job acceptance than to provide genuine income support.

Pursue legislation extending UI coverage to gig economy workers, farmworkers, and domestic workers who are currently excluded from state UI systems, funded through new employer contributions from the platforms and firms that employ them.

---

### Reform IX: Retirement Security and ERISA Enforcement

#### Pension Solvency and the PBGC

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures the pension benefits of approximately 33 million Americans in defined benefit pension plans. The PBGC's multiemployer insurance program faced a long-term funding deficit that was partially addressed by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Direct the PBGC to fully implement the Special Financial Assistance program for financially troubled multiemployer plans, ensuring that workers in industries including trucking, coal mining, and construction receive the pension benefits they were promised.

Pursue legislation to strengthen PBGC's insurance premiums and investment authority, reducing the long-term risk of pension insurance fund insolvency without reducing worker benefits.

#### Fiduciary Rule and Retirement Plan Investment

Issue an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Labor to immediately reinstate the Biden administration's fiduciary rule, requiring financial professionals advising retirement savers to act in their clients' best interests (a fiduciary standard) rather than merely recommending "suitable" investments that may serve the advisor's interest over the client's. The Trump administration rescinded this rule; its reinstatement protects the retirement savings of millions of Americans from conflicted investment advice.

#### Multiple Employer Plans and Expanded Retirement Coverage

Approximately 57 million private-sector workers — primarily at small businesses — have no access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. The SECURE Act of 2019 and SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 took steps to expand retirement plan access through multiple employer plan (MEP) pooling arrangements. Pursue legislation to build on this framework with an automatic enrollment requirement for employers with 10 or more employees, with a government-administered "retirement savings account" default option for workers whose employers do not offer a plan — modeled on the Thrift Savings Plan available to federal employees. Direct the EBSA to issue guidance facilitating the formation of MEPs for gig economy workers and workers in industries without traditional employer-sponsored plans.

The retirement security crisis falls most heavily on Black and Hispanic workers, women workers, and workers in low-wage occupations — the same workers most harmed by the broader labor policy failures this chapter addresses. Closing the retirement savings gap requires both expanding access to retirement savings vehicles and raising wages and union density so that workers have income available to save.

---

### Reform X: Anti-Discrimination Enforcement and OFCCP

#### The Intersection of Labor Rights and Civil Rights

Labor rights and civil rights are not separate policy domains. The workers most systematically denied labor protections — undocumented agricultural workers, tipped restaurant workers, domestic care workers, garment workers — are disproportionately women, workers of color, and immigrants. The employers most likely to steal wages, resist unionization, and maintain unsafe working conditions operate in sectors where the workforce lacks the economic and legal power to enforce its rights without vigorous government intervention.

This intersection requires coordination across agencies. The Department of Labor administers labor standards and workforce programs. The EEOC enforces Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.) prohibiting employment discrimination. The DOJ Civil Rights Division enforces civil rights laws against state and local government employers and investigates pattern-or-practice discrimination. Historically, these agencies have operated in silos. The White House Worker Empowerment Council, established in the First 100 Days, must break down these silos and produce a coordinated enforcement strategy that treats labor exploitation and civil rights violation as two manifestations of the same underlying power imbalance.

#### Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs

The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) enforces Executive Order 11246 and related statutes requiring federal contractors to maintain nondiscriminatory employment practices and to take affirmative action in recruiting, hiring, and promotion. The OFCCP covers approximately 200,000 federal contractors employing approximately 25 percent of the U.S. workforce.

The Trump administration's attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs have targeted OFCCP's affirmative action requirements. Issue an Executive Order confirming that federal contractors are required to maintain nondiscriminatory employment practices, that affirmative action requirements under E.O. 11246 remain in force, and directing the OFCCP to resume audits of federal contractors for compliance.

#### Pay Equity and Compensation Data Collection

Reinstate the equal pay data collection initiative, which requires federal contractors to submit aggregate compensation data by race and gender to the OFCCP and EEOC. This data is essential for identifying systemic pay discrimination and targeting enforcement resources. The Trump administration rescinded this requirement in 2017; it must be restored and extended to cover all covered contractors.

---

### Reform XI: Child Labor Enforcement

#### The Resurgence of Illegal Child Labor

The number of children found employed in violation of the FLSA's child labor provisions has increased dramatically in recent years. The Labor Department found a 69 percent increase in the number of children illegally employed between 2018 and 2022. Investigations have found children working in slaughterhouses, on automotive factory floors at night, in glass factories, and in other hazardous occupations explicitly prohibited by 29 U.S.C. § 212 and 29 C.F.R. Part 570.

Project 2025 does not propose strengthening child labor enforcement. Instead, several of its allied organizations have advocated weakening protections for children in employment, framing 14-year-olds working in meatpacking as "youth work experience." This administration rejects this framing entirely. Child labor violations are federal crimes. This administration will prosecute them.

#### Strengthen Child Labor Penalties and Enforcement

Pursue legislation to increase civil penalties for child labor violations under 29 U.S.C. § 216(e) from $15,625 per violation to $100,000 per violation, with criminal penalties for willful violations that endanger children's health or safety elevated from Class A misdemeanor to federal felony. Direct the WHD to establish a dedicated Child Labor Enforcement Unit with personnel and resources dedicated specifically to identifying and prosecuting child labor violations, including coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services on children in the unaccompanied minors program who have been trafficked into exploitative employment.

Establish a formal DOL-DOJ memorandum of understanding requiring WHD to refer all cases of child labor violations that result in serious injury or death to the DOJ for criminal prosecution, and all cases involving the use of child labor as a result of human trafficking to the DOJ's Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit.

#### Agricultural Child Labor Exemptions Must End

The FLSA's agricultural child labor exemptions — permitting children as young as 12 to work in agriculture with parental consent and children as young as 14 to work in agriculture without restriction — represent the most indefensible double standard in federal labor law. In every other industry, the minimum working age is 14, with strict restrictions until age 18. In agriculture, there is effectively no minimum age with parental consent.

Agricultural work is one of the most dangerous occupations for any worker. It is especially dangerous for children: the leading cause of work-related death for minors is agricultural injuries. Pursue legislation to establish the same child labor protections in agriculture as apply in all other industries, eliminating the agricultural exemption from 29 U.S.C. § 213(c).

---

### Reform XII: Department of Labor Institutional Reform and Capacity

#### Restoring DOL Budget and Staffing Capacity

The Department of Labor's budget has been systematically reduced as a share of federal spending for decades, even as the agency's legal responsibilities have grown. The Trump administration's proposed FY 2026 budget included devastating cuts across DOL agencies — not only at OSHA but at WHD, OLMS (Office of Labor-Management Standards), and ETA. This administration will pursue supplemental appropriations in the first budget cycle to restore DOL to at minimum its pre-Trump staffing levels and then pursue additional increases tied to specific enforcement and program expansion mandates.

The Solicitor of Labor's office — the legal arm of the Department — must be fully staffed to defend DOL's rulemaking, enforce labor statutes, and coordinate with the DOJ on criminal labor law prosecutions. The Solicitor's office has also been a target of political interference by administrations seeking to slow enforcement; this administration will insulate the career legal staff from political direction through clear administrative procedures.

#### Bureau of Labor Statistics Independence

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is the United States' principal statistical agency for labor market data. Its reports — unemployment rates, inflation measures, the Consumer Price Index, occupational injury and illness surveys — are the empirical foundation for virtually all labor policy. The Trump administration has attempted to use BLS data politically, including through attempts to suppress or delay unfavorable data releases.

Issue an Executive Order establishing an Office of Statistical Independence within OMB, modeled on the independence protections applicable to the Federal Reserve's research functions, prohibiting political officials from pressuring BLS to delay, modify, or suppress data releases. Pursue legislation codifying BLS's operational independence in statute.

#### International Labor Standards and Trade Policy Integration

The United States is a member of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and has ratified a small fraction of ILO conventions — fewer than any other major industrialized nation. Many ILO core conventions — including Convention 87 (Freedom of Association) and Convention 98 (Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining) — have not been ratified by the United States because of conflicts with U.S. labor law. The PRO Act's passage would remove the primary legal barriers to Convention 87 and 98 ratification.

Direct the Secretary of Labor, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the U.S. Trade Representative, to integrate ILO core labor standards into U.S. trade agreement negotiations and enforcement, ensuring that trading partners meet minimum internationally recognized labor standards as a condition of preferential trade access. Enforce existing labor chapter provisions in the USMCA, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, and bilateral trade agreements, with a specific mandate to pursue arbitration against trading partners whose labor law violations are verified by the ILO.

The domestic politics of trade policy are inseparable from the domestic politics of labor rights. American workers who lose jobs to competitors in countries with lower wages, fewer safety requirements, and union suppression are not losing those jobs to free market efficiency — they are losing them to unfair competition enabled by the failure of U.S. trade law to enforce core labor standards. Enforcing international labor standards in trade agreements is not protectionism. It is the application of the same principle of fair competition that underlies domestic labor law: workers everywhere deserve a floor below which wages and conditions cannot fall.

#### Protecting Immigrant Workers

Immigrant workers — both documented and undocumented — face unique vulnerabilities in the labor market. Many are employed in industries with high rates of labor law violation. Many fear reporting violations because doing so risks immigration consequences. Project 2025's immigration enforcement agenda, which this administration addresses comprehensively in Chapter 5 (Homeland Security), has a direct labor dimension: the use of immigration enforcement as a tool of union suppression and worker intimidation is well-documented. Employers who report undocumented workers to ICE during or after a union organizing campaign, or in retaliation for wage theft complaints, are engaged in a form of labor coercion that strikes at the foundations of the labor law framework.

Issue an Executive Order directing the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor to establish a formal protocol under which immigration enforcement actions may not be taken against workers who have filed or are identified as witnesses in pending wage and hour, OSHA, or NLRA proceedings, unless there is an independent law enforcement basis for the action. Direct WHD to issue "U visa" certification guidance for undocumented workers who are victims of serious labor crimes, facilitating their access to the immigration protection available under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U) for victims of qualifying crimes.
