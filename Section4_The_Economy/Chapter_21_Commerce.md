# Chapter 21: Department of Commerce

## Executive Summary

The Department of Commerce is the federal government's primary instrument for economic stewardship, scientific infrastructure, and competitive positioning in the global economy. Its portfolio spans eleven distinct bureaus and more than forty thousand employees: the Census Bureau produces the demographic and economic data that underpins every federal formula grant and congressional apportionment; NOAA operates the National Weather Service and the nation's satellite and ocean monitoring networks; NIST sets measurement standards and runs the AI Safety Institute; the Bureau of Economic Analysis calculates GDP and the national accounts; the Bureau of Industry and Security administers export controls; NTIA manages the electromagnetic spectrum and administers the $42.5 billion BEAD broadband program; the International Trade Administration promotes American exports; the Minority Business Development Agency serves minority entrepreneurs; and the Economic Development Administration funds regional economic recovery. These functions are not peripheral bureaucracy. They are the measurement, forecast, and infrastructure systems on which a modern economy depends.

Project 2025's "Mandate for Leadership" designates the Commerce Department as a primary target for ideological dismantling. The document directs that NOAA "should be broken up and downsized" and that the National Weather Service "should fully commercialize its forecasting operations," characterizing the agency as "a primary component of the climate change alarm industry." *(Project 2025, p. 664)* It calls for reviewing and restructuring the Census Bureau's data collection programs, privatizing core scientific functions, and eliminating the MBDA. The Trump administration, beginning January 20, 2025, translated these blueprints into operational orders. DOGE personnel removed approximately 880 NOAA employees in a single day — February 27, 2025 — on top of the 550 who had already departed through early retirement and probationary terminations since January. The National Weather Service fell below 4,000 employees for the first time in its history, thirty forecast offices lost their lead meteorologist, and the Goodland, Kansas office became the first NWS facility to end 24-hour operations. NIST was directed to cut approximately 497 staff, eliminating most of the probationary workforce at the AI Safety Institute and gutting the CHIPS Act semiconductor research teams. The MBDA was effectively shuttered — all remaining career employees received reduction-in-force notices — before a federal court injunction halted the dissolution. The BEAD broadband program, which had spent years building state deployment plans, was forced to restart from scratch under new ideologically motivated rules that eliminated fiber preferences and introduced satellite provider advantages. The Census Bureau's advisory committees were eliminated and DOGE personnel moved to terminate multiple active survey programs.

A new administration must treat Commerce not as a collection of programs to administer but as a set of national capabilities to rebuild and strengthen. The mission is: restore the headcount and operational capacity of NOAA and the National Weather Service; recommit to NOAA's climate science mandate; fully fund and implement the CHIPS Act semiconductor program; accelerate BEAD broadband completion; restore the MBDA and expand it; reconstitute the NIST AI Safety Institute with permanent statutory authority; reform export controls to advance both national security and economic competition; and protect the independence of federal statistical agencies. These reforms are not optional improvements. They are the baseline requirements for a government capable of protecting American lives, advancing the competitiveness of American industry, and meeting its constitutional obligation to promote the general welfare.

**The Stakes**: Thirty forecast offices operating without lead meteorologists during an era of accelerating hurricane intensification is not a budget efficiency — it is a life-safety catastrophe deferred. A BEAD program frozen by ideological rewrites means approximately 21 million Americans remain without broadband access while billions in already-appropriated funds sit unspent. Gutting the AI Safety Institute cedes the global standard-setting role in artificial intelligence to the European Union and the People's Republic of China at the moment American dominance in that domain is most consequential.

**Key Reforms**:
- Full restoration of NOAA and NWS workforce to pre-2025 levels, with statutory workforce minimums and protection against future DOGE-style purges
- Recommitment to NOAA's climate science mission, including restoration of satellite programs and the GeoXO constellation at full specification
- Reconstitution of the NIST AI Safety Institute with independent statutory authorization and mandatory model evaluation requirements
- Immediate resumption of BEAD broadband program implementation under original Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act rules, with binding completion deadlines
- Restoration and expansion of the MBDA, with increased funding, additional business centers, and a new capital access program
- Protection of Census Bureau statistical independence through legislation prohibiting executive interference with survey programs and data collection
- Strategic restructuring of Bureau of Industry and Security export controls to close loopholes allowing transshipment to restricted Chinese entities
- Full acceleration of CHIPS Act semiconductor manufacturing and R&D programs, including restoration of Natcast and related institutions
- Restoration of EDA funding with targeted investment in rural and historically underserved communities
- Reform of the USPTO fee-diversion problem through mandatory fee retention and targeted examination hiring

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Commerce Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3); Commerce Department Organization Act (15 U.S.C. § 1501 et seq.); Census Act (13 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.); Weather Service Organic Act (15 U.S.C. § 313); NOAA enabling legislation (33 U.S.C. § 851); CHIPS and Science Act (Pub. L. 117-167); Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117-58), Title V (BEAD); Minority Business Development Act of 2021 (15 U.S.C. § 9501 et seq.); Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. § 3121 et seq.); Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. § 4801 et seq.); National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (15 U.S.C. § 3701 et seq.); America COMPETES Act (Pub. L. 110-69).

## Part I: Project 2025 Commerce Department Damage and Destruction

### The Assault on NOAA and the National Weather Service

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The Heritage Foundation's "Mandate for Leadership" chapter on the Department of Commerce, authored by Thomas Gilman, a former Trump administration official, begins with a declaration of ideological war against NOAA. The document states that NOAA "should be broken up and downsized," that it has become "a primary component of the climate change alarm industry," and that the National Weather Service "should fully commercialize its forecasting operations." *(Project 2025, pp. 664-666)* It calls for reviewing the National Hurricane Center and treating NOAA's climate research programs as mission creep rather than core function.

The Trump administration translated this blueprint into action before the 2025 spring severe weather season. On February 27, 2025, OPM abruptly terminated approximately 880 NOAA employees — over 7.3 percent of total agency staff — in a single day. Combined with approximately 550 additional departures through early retirement acceptances and probationary terminations since January 20, the National Weather Service fell below 4,000 employees for the first time in agency history. The vacancy rate at National Weather Service forecast offices reached approximately 30 percent nationwide. Thirty offices were operating without a lead meteorologist. The Goodland, Kansas office became the first NWS facility to abandon 24-hour continuous operations, with approximately a dozen additional offices projected to follow.

**Specific Operational Consequences:**

Weather balloon launches — a critical tool for atmospheric profiling that provides essential data inputs to numerical weather prediction models — were suspended at multiple stations due to staffing shortages. Hurricane hunter aircraft operations were reduced, degrading the real-time data gathering on developing Atlantic storms at the opening of hurricane season. The teams responsible for developing and maintaining numerical weather prediction computer models were, in the words of NOAA insiders, "gutted." NOAA databases and public-facing websites went offline during the staffing chaos. The severe weather alert teams that issue tornado warnings, flash flood emergencies, and winter storm warnings were stretched to cover larger geographic territories with longer individual shifts — a condition that degrades judgment precisely when accurate judgment matters most.

**Satellite Program Attacks:**

Beyond the workforce purge, the administration moved to degrade NOAA's satellite data infrastructure. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), operated through the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC), was directed to cut off microwave satellite data distribution to NOAA by June 30, 2025 — the opening of peak Atlantic hurricane season. This data is irreplaceable: DMSP microwave instruments provide three-dimensional internal storm structure data and overnight intensity information that optical satellites cannot replicate. After emergency intervention by NOAA and NASA officials, the cutoff was delayed to July 31, 2025, before a subsequent Navy reversal preserved the data stream — but the episode exposed the administration's willingness to weaponize satellite data as a budget line item during active hurricane risk.

The Office of Management and Budget moved to cancel the GeoXO constellation — NOAA's planned next-generation geostationary satellite system designed to replace the aging GOES series — in favor of a stripped-down replacement at half the original planned cost with fewer sensors and less sophisticated instruments. The Trump administration separately directed the removal of ocean and air pollution monitoring instruments from next-generation weather satellite specifications, eliminating capabilities that serve both weather forecasting and environmental compliance monitoring.

### The Dismantling of NIST and the AI Safety Institute

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 calls for restructuring NIST to eliminate what it characterizes as mission creep into climate and equity research, and its broader antipathy toward AI safety regulation reflects the document's consistent hostility to any government role in technology governance. *(Project 2025, pp. 680-682)*

The Trump administration's DOGE operation directed NIST to prepare mass terminations beginning in February 2025. NIST prepared to cut approximately 497 employees — the overwhelming majority being probationary staff, which included most of the specialized technical workforce at the AI Safety Institute (AISI) and most of the CHIPS Act semiconductor program officers. AISI Director Elizabeth Kelly resigned in January; the institute's leader departed before the February purge. NIST Director Laurie Locascio stepped down at the start of the year.

Rather than formally abolishing AISI, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick rebranded it as the "Center for AI Standards and Innovation" (CAISI), removing "safety" from the institute's name and mandate, and pivoting its mission from AI safety evaluation toward national security applications and global competitiveness. The substantive AI safety evaluation function — independent testing of frontier AI models against safety benchmarks before deployment — was eliminated in practice through the combination of leadership vacuums, staff purges, and mission redirection.

**Consequences for CHIPS Act Implementation:**

The mass NIST terminations nearly eliminated the workforce administering the CHIPS and Science Act's $39 billion in manufacturing incentives and $11 billion in R&D programs. The cuts slashed approximately 60 percent of the staff handling manufacturing incentive programs and approximately two-thirds of the staff overseeing R&D initiatives. The Trump administration took action against the National Semiconductor Technology Center (Natcast), which was established under the CHIPS Act as the primary institution for advancing domestic semiconductor research, halting its operations and eventually moving to terminate its foundational contracts. A separate $285 million CHIPS Act-funded digital twins consortium was terminated mid-program.

The CHIPS Act was designed as a generational investment in American semiconductor manufacturing independence, motivated directly by the national security vulnerability exposed by COVID-19 supply chain failures. Gutting the implementing workforce does not eliminate the vulnerability — it extends it while the funding authority exists but cannot be deployed.

### The Destruction of the Minority Business Development Agency

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 calls for the elimination of the MBDA, characterizing its mandate to serve minority business enterprises as inconsistent with a "color-blind" federal government. *(Project 2025, pp. 683-684)* The Trump administration executed this directive through Executive Order 14238, signed March 14, 2025, directing the MBDA and other targeted agencies to eliminate all "non-statutory components" and reduce statutory functions "to the minimum presence and function required by law."

The administration sent reduction-in-force notices to every remaining MBDA employee — all 23 career staff after earlier rounds of downsizing — effectively shuttering the agency that Congress had permanently authorized in 2021 through the Minority Business Development Act, enacted as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117-58). The MBDA's 2023 performance demonstrates what was destroyed: the agency helped minority business enterprises access $1.5 billion in capital, facilitated nearly $3.8 billion in contracts, and helped create or sustain more than 19,000 jobs. Regional business centers were closed across the country, including the Wisconsin MBDA office.

Twenty-one states brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. On May 13, 2025, the court issued a preliminary injunction halting the dismantling, finding the executive action likely violated the Minority Business Development Act of 2021. The administration's attempt to shutter a congressionally mandated agency through executive fiat was preliminarily restrained — but the damage to staff, networks, and ongoing client relationships was not undone by the injunction.

---

### The Assault on the BEAD Broadband Program

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 opposes the BEAD program's technology preferences — particularly its preference for fiber optic deployment — as market interference, and objects to any broadband program requirements related to equity, labor standards, or community benefit agreements. *(Project 2025, pp. 686-688)*

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act's $42.45 billion BEAD program, administered through NTIA, was designed to close the broadband access gap affecting approximately 21 million Americans. States spent years developing deployment plans under NTIA guidance, with many receiving conditional approval from the Biden administration. On March 5, 2025, Secretary Lutnick announced a "rigorous review" of BEAD and launched a process to revamp the program. In June 2025, NTIA published new rules rescinding all previous guidance and conditional approvals and requiring states to resubmit their deployment plans within 90 days under new technology-neutral rules.

The new rules replaced the fiber preference — which prioritizes the highest-capacity, most durable broadband technology — with lowest-cost bidding criteria, incentivizing satellite providers over fiber deployment. States that had spent years building fiber deployment networks for their plans found those plans invalidated. Fiber bidders dropped out of state competitions. Low-Earth orbit satellite providers — including Elon Musk's Starlink — entered as preferred alternatives. As of the end of 2025, no BEAD funding had been distributed for any eligible broadband deployment project. The program lost a minimum of one additional year, and the communities waiting for connectivity — disproportionately rural, tribal, and low-income — waited longer.

---

### The Targeting of Census Bureau Independence and Economic Data

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 proposes restructuring the Census Bureau to reduce its survey portfolio and data collection programs, and its broader framework envisions presidential control over independent statistical agencies. *(Project 2025, pp. 672-674)* The citizenship question controversy during Trump's first term — where the administration attempted to insert a citizenship question into the 2020 decennial census for the stated purpose of reducing immigrant representation, before the Supreme Court blocked it in *Department of Commerce v. New York*, 588 U.S. 752 (2019) — demonstrated the vulnerability of statistical independence to political manipulation.

In the second administration, DOGE personnel moved to create a "survey of surveys" — a catalog of Census Bureau data collection programs designated for termination. Five surveys were publicly announced as terminated on social media. The Commerce Department eliminated the Census Bureau's advisory committees, removing the external demographers, statisticians, and subject-matter experts who provide methodological oversight. An Inspector General's report in March 2025 warned of hiring and retention failures at the Bureau undermining ongoing survey quality.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis, which calculates GDP, the national accounts, and trade balances, faced similar pressure. Data independence is not an abstract principle: the GDP and employment numbers produced by BEA and BLS are the metrics against which economic policy is evaluated. Political interference with those measurements does not change economic reality — it prevents its accurate perception.

---

### The Weaponization of Commerce Department Leadership

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 envisions the Department of Commerce Secretary as an instrument of political agenda-setting rather than professional management, and calls explicitly for the Secretary to exercise personal control over agency operations in ways that override career staff expertise. *(Project 2025, pp. 663-664)* The selection of Howard Lutnick — a Wall Street financier with no relevant scientific, economic policy, or trade administration background — to lead the Department under this framework was not coincidental. It was the implementation of the principle.

Under Secretary Lutnick's direction, the Commerce Department pursued a coordinated ideological agenda across its bureaus: the NOAA purge executed the Project 2025 plan to "break up" the agency; the AISI rebranding executed the plan to eliminate AI safety oversight; the BEAD revamp executed the plan to eliminate technology preferences and equity requirements; the MBDA dismantlement executed the plan to eliminate race-conscious programming; and the Census Bureau targeting executed the plan to reduce government data collection. These actions were not independent policy decisions — they were a coordinated implementation of a prepared blueprint.

The result is that the most technically sophisticated federal department — the one whose functions require the deepest domain expertise in atmospheric science, semiconductor physics, measurement standards, statistics, and telecommunications engineering — was run by officials whose primary qualifications were political loyalty and ideological alignment. The damage is not merely to individual programs but to the institutional capacity to run those programs, which depends on retaining experienced career staff who possess knowledge that cannot be rapidly reconstructed.

---

### The Human Cost

The damage imposed on the Department of Commerce during 2025 falls hardest on specific populations:

The 30-percent NWS vacancy rate and the elimination of 24/7 operations at forecast offices creates unequal warning capacity — communities in regions served by understaffed offices receive less accurate and less timely severe weather warnings than communities in fully staffed regions. Approximately 600 people die annually in the United States from weather-related events that accurate forecasting helps prevent. The degradation of hurricane intensity forecasting creates direct life-safety risk for millions of Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast residents. Approximately 50 million Americans live in areas directly served by NWS forecast offices that lost their lead meteorologist in 2025. A single missed tornado warning — the product of an understaffed office whose forecasters are covering territories too large for reliable monitoring — can kill dozens of people in minutes. That is not a hypothetical: tornado-related deaths have historically spiked during periods when NWS staffing was reduced in affected regions.

The MBDA dissolution eliminates the only federal agency with a statutory mandate to serve minority business enterprises. Minority-owned businesses face documented capital access gaps: minority entrepreneurs receive approximately one-third the startup capital of white entrepreneurs at equivalent qualifications. The MBDA's business center network provided targeted capital navigation, contracting assistance, and technical support that market actors do not provide on their own. There are approximately 4.2 million minority-owned employer businesses in the United States. The MBDA served as the primary federal point of contact for those businesses navigating federal procurement, accessing capital, and scaling their operations. The void left by the MBDA's dismantlement is not filled by SBA programs designed for a general small business population.

The BEAD delays extend broadband deprivation in communities where broadband access determines access to telehealth, remote education, remote employment, and emergency communication. Tribal communities, rural agricultural regions, and low-income peri-urban areas are disproportionately represented in the 21 million Americans who remain without broadband access. The economic cost of broadband deprivation compounds over time: every year without broadband is a year in which rural students cannot access online educational resources, rural patients cannot access telehealth consultations with specialists, and rural entrepreneurs cannot access e-commerce markets. The Trump administration's decision to restart the BEAD program from scratch in June 2025 — after states had spent years building deployment plans — imposed a cost measured not only in dollars but in lost educational opportunity, foregone healthcare access, and deferred economic development that will not be recovered.

The CHIPS Act disruption threatens a national security interest that the entire U.S. government, across administrations of both parties, identified as urgent: American semiconductor manufacturing independence. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated in real time what happens when the supply chain for critical technology components is concentrated in geopolitically vulnerable locations — automotive plants idled, military electronics programs delayed, consumer electronics shortfalls that cost the American economy an estimated $240 billion. Gutting the workforce implementing the legislative solution to that problem, while leaving the underlying vulnerability unaddressed, is a decision that will cost American national security in the next supply chain crisis.

The termination of Census Bureau surveys eliminates data that is not merely useful but foundational: the American Community Survey is the data source for federal formula allocations that distribute hundreds of billions of dollars annually to state and local governments for education, healthcare, housing, and transportation. Errors or gaps in ACS data propagate into systematic misallocation of federal resources, disadvantaging the communities with the most acute needs — which are, by definition, the communities least capable of compensating with alternative resources.

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

The Department of Commerce draws constitutional authority from multiple provisions of Article I. The Commerce Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3) authorizes Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states, grounding the Department's trade promotion, export control, and economic development functions. The Patent Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8) grants Congress authority to promote the progress of science and useful arts, providing the constitutional basis for the Patent and Trademark Office. The Census Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 3) mandates an actual enumeration of the population for apportionment purposes, creating an affirmative constitutional obligation to conduct an accurate decennial census. The Necessary and Proper Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18) authorizes the legislative and regulatory infrastructure that supports all Commerce Department functions.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Commerce Department Organization Act** (15 U.S.C. § 1501 et seq.): Establishes the Department of Commerce and the Secretary's authority over its component agencies.

**Census Act** (13 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.): Mandates the decennial census and authorizes the ongoing survey programs of the Census Bureau, including the American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, and the Economic Census.

**Weather Service Organic Act** (15 U.S.C. § 313): Establishes the National Weather Service and its mission to provide weather forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property.

**NOAA Enabling Legislation** (33 U.S.C. § 851; 15 U.S.C. § 313 et seq.): Authorizes NOAA's atmospheric, oceanic, and satellite programs, including National Weather Service operations and fisheries management.

**CHIPS and Science Act** (Pub. L. 117-167, 136 Stat. 1371 (2022)): Appropriates $39 billion in manufacturing incentives and $11 billion in R&D funding administered through NIST and the CHIPS Program Office, and establishes the National Semiconductor Technology Center.

**Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act** (Pub. L. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429 (2021)), Title V: Appropriates $42.45 billion for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program, administered by NTIA through 15 U.S.C. § 1305.

**Minority Business Development Act of 2021** (15 U.S.C. § 9501 et seq.): Permanently establishes the MBDA, mandates its business center network, and defines its statutory mission to promote the growth and competitiveness of minority business enterprises.

**Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965** (42 U.S.C. § 3121 et seq.): Authorizes EDA grant and loan programs for economically distressed communities.

**Export Control Reform Act of 2018** (50 U.S.C. § 4801 et seq.): Provides the statutory authority for the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security.

**Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act** (15 U.S.C. § 3701 et seq.): Authorizes NIST's technology transfer and standards programs and provides the foundational authority for federal technology partnership with industry.

**National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act** (15 U.S.C. § 272 note): Requires federal agencies to use technical standards developed by voluntary consensus standards bodies, with NIST coordination responsibility.

### Statistical Independence: The Legal and Institutional Framework

The independence of federal statistical agencies from political interference is grounded in the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (44 U.S.C. § 3561 et seq.), which prohibits the use of Census Bureau data for non-statistical purposes, and in the longstanding professional norms codified in OMB Statistical Policy Directives. The *Department of Commerce v. New York* decision (588 U.S. 752 (2019)) established that courts will scrutinize pretext claims when the stated justification for census changes does not match the actual rationale — a precedent that constrains but does not eliminate executive meddling. Statutory protection for statistical agency independence requires explicit legislative action to achieve durability.

### Trade and Market Access: ITA's Role

The International Trade Administration promotes American export competitiveness through market access negotiations, enforcement of trade remedy laws (antidumping, countervailing duty), and trade development programs. ITA administers the antidumping and countervailing duty statutes (19 U.S.C. § 1673 et seq.; 19 U.S.C. § 1671 et seq.), conducts country-specific investigations, and represents American business interests in trade dispute forums. The Trump administration's use of Commerce Department trade functions for punitive tariff calculations — disconnected from strategic trade policy objectives and driven by political negotiation tactics — degraded the credibility of ITA's fact-finding role and undermined the rules-based trade enforcement framework that American exporters depend on for market access.

The administration will restore ITA to its proper role: rigorous, evidence-based trade remedy administration that enforces trade laws without political direction, combined with proactive market access advocacy for American exporters in priority markets. Direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Trade Enforcement Prioritization Committee that identifies the three highest-priority market access barriers confronting American exporters in each major trading partner country, develops enforcement strategies, and reports progress to Congress annually.

---

## Part III: Comprehensive Commerce Department Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: NOAA and National Weather Service Full Restoration

The administration will immediately reverse all NOAA and National Weather Service workforce reductions imposed by DOGE and the Trump administration's February 2025 mass terminations. Restoration is not optional — the Weather Service Organic Act (15 U.S.C. § 313) charges NOAA with providing forecasts and warnings necessary to protect life and property, a statutory mission that cannot be fulfilled at 70 percent staffing.

**Workforce Restoration Actions:**

Issue an executive order within the first week directing the Secretary of Commerce to reinstate all NOAA and NWS employees separated since January 20, 2025, consistent with applicable civil service law and merit system principles. Direct the Office of Personnel Management to expedite the processing of reinstatement actions and to treat NOAA and NWS positions as critical safety positions exempt from any future across-the-board hiring freezes. Restore 24-hour continuous operations at all National Weather Service forecast offices that had downgraded to part-time operations. Restore full staffing at all forecast offices to at minimum pre-January 2025 levels within 180 days.

**Satellite Program Restoration:**

Direct the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Defense, within 30 days, to restore full Defense Meteorological Satellite Program data sharing with NOAA, formalized through an updated interagency memorandum of agreement. Reinstate the GeoXO constellation program at its full original specification, with the environmental and pollution monitoring sensors removed by the prior administration restored to the satellite design. Initiate an independent National Academies review of the GeoXO program scope to ensure the replacement geostationary satellite constellation meets the needs of the 21st-century weather enterprise.

**Climate Science Mission Restoration:**

Formally reaffirm NOAA's mandate to conduct climate science research and to provide climate forecasting services, through both executive order and rulemaking. Rescind any administrative directives from the prior administration restricting NOAA employees from using terms including "climate change," "global warming," or "sea level rise" in official communications or public forecasts. Restore full funding to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, including the climate-related research programs that were administratively defunded or staff-depleted.

**Legislative Requirement:** The Weather Service Workforce Protection and Independence Act (proposed) will establish statutory minimum staffing levels for National Weather Service forecast offices, require Senate-confirmed leadership for NOAA with professional meteorological or atmospheric science qualifications, and prohibit the application of across-the-board workforce reduction orders to NWS emergency operations centers without specific congressional authorization.

---

### Reform II: NIST Reconstitution and AI Safety Institute Restoration

The AI Safety Institute will be restored and expanded as an independent center within NIST with statutory authority, moving beyond its prior executive-order basis to a durable legislative foundation. The administration will direct the Secretary of Commerce to immediately rescind the rebranding of AISI as CAISI, restore its original name and mandate, and direct the recruitment and rapid hiring of the technical staff eliminated in February 2025.

**AI Safety Institute Restoration:**

Direct the hiring of not fewer than 100 full-time AI safety researchers, evaluators, and technical staff within 180 days. Reinstate the AISI's pre-January 2025 framework agreements with frontier AI developers for voluntary model evaluation. Direct AISI to publish updated AI safety evaluation guidelines within 90 days, building on the work that was disrupted by the 2025 leadership vacuum.

**Mandatory Pre-Deployment Evaluation:**

Issue an executive order requiring that frontier AI systems, defined as those trained with compute thresholds exceeding standards set by NIST in consultation with the scientific community, undergo AISI evaluation before deployment to U.S. government systems. This creates an immediate market for AISI services and builds the evaluation database necessary for informed safety standard-setting.

**NIST Workforce Restoration:**

Restore all NIST employees terminated in the February 2025 DOGE purge who had not voluntarily departed or been terminated for cause. Immediately restore the full workforce of the CHIPS Program Office and direct the resumption of all CHIPS Act grant administration activities.

**Legislative Requirement:** The AI Safety and Standards Act (proposed) will establish AISI as an independent center within NIST with mandatory appropriations, a director subject to Senate confirmation, and authority to require pre-deployment testing of high-risk AI systems under notice-and-comment rulemaking authority.

---

### Reform III: CHIPS Act Full Implementation and Semiconductor Industrial Policy

The CHIPS and Science Act represents the most consequential industrial policy legislation enacted in a generation. Its premise — that the United States cannot permit semiconductor manufacturing to be concentrated in geopolitically vulnerable locations — is correct and bipartisan. The Trump administration's decision to gut the implementing workforce while nominally preserving the statute is a form of sabotage: the authority exists but cannot be exercised.

**Immediate Restoration Actions:**

Direct the CHIPS Program Office within NIST to resume all suspended grant administration activities, including review of pending applications and acceleration of execution of agreements in advanced stages of negotiation. Direct the Secretary of Commerce to restore Natcast to operational status and rescind all Commerce Department actions taken against the National Semiconductor Technology Center. Reinstate the $285 million digital twins consortium and other terminated CHIPS R&D contracts, or initiate a new competitive process to replace the terminated work on an accelerated timeline.

**Strategic Acceleration:**

The administration will publish a National Semiconductor Strategy within 90 days, coordinating CHIPS Act manufacturing incentives with Defense Department procurement preferences, NSF research funding, and Export-Import Bank financing to maximize the leverage of the CHIPS appropriation. Target: three new leading-edge semiconductor fabrication facilities under construction in the United States within four years, with associated supplier ecosystem investment in packaging, chemicals, and equipment manufacturing.

**Workforce Pipeline:**

Direct NSF, the Department of Education, and the Department of Labor to develop a coordinated semiconductor workforce pipeline, connecting community college programs, apprenticeship systems, and university engineering programs to the specific hiring needs of CHIPS Act grantee facilities. The workforce shortage is the most immediate constraint on CHIPS Act success: the industry will need approximately 100,000 additional skilled workers by 2030.

---

### Reform IV: BEAD Broadband Program Immediate Restart

The $42.45 billion BEAD program will be restarted on an emergency basis. The Trump administration's June 2025 revamp added a minimum of one year of delay to a program that was already behind schedule. Every month of delay represents continued deprivation for communities where broadband determines access to healthcare, employment, and education.

**Immediate Policy Actions:**

Direct NTIA, within 30 days of the new administration's commencement, to rescind the June 2025 rules and restore the BEAD program guidance as it stood on January 19, 2025, with the addition of binding completion deadlines that were absent from the original implementation. States that had received conditional approval of their Initial Proposals under the Biden administration will have those approvals reinstated automatically and may proceed to Final Proposal submission under the pre-June 2025 rules.

**Technology Standards:**

Restore the fiber preference in BEAD program eligibility rules. Fiber optic infrastructure provides symmetrical gigabit capacity, 30-year service life, and resistance to weather interference that no currently available alternative technology matches. Technology-neutral rules that treat satellite broadband as equivalent to fiber deployment are not neutral — they are preferential treatment for lower-quality infrastructure at equivalent federal cost.

**Tribal and Rural Priority:**

Direct NTIA to establish an accelerated review track for Tribal Nation BEAD applications, with 60-day review windows and dedicated technical assistance. Tribal communities have the most severe broadband access deficits and have faced the greatest administrative barriers throughout the BEAD process.

**Completion Deadline:**

Set a statutory target: all BEAD-funded broadband infrastructure to be in service by December 31, 2028. Establish a quarterly Congressional reporting requirement on NTIA's progress against that target, with automatic remediation authority to redirect funding from non-performing state programs to alternative deployment mechanisms if states fail to meet milestone dates.

---

### Reform V: MBDA Restoration and Minority Business Expansion

The Minority Business Development Agency will be restored to full operational capacity, consistent with the Minority Business Development Act of 2021 (15 U.S.C. § 9501 et seq.), within 60 days. The administration will direct the Secretary of Commerce to reinstate all MBDA employees separated under Executive Order 14238, immediately reopen all closed business centers, and publish a notice rescinding the March 14, 2025 Executive Order's directives as applied to the MBDA.

**Expansion Beyond Restoration:**

The restored MBDA will be expanded, not merely returned to its prior state. Direct the Secretary to submit a budget request increasing MBDA funding by 50 percent above the pre-2025 baseline, to open 30 new business centers in underserved markets where no federal small business assistance currently reaches, and to establish a dedicated capital access program through which MBDA-certified minority business enterprises can access SBA-backed loan guarantee programs on an expedited basis.

**Federal Contracting:**

Direct all Cabinet departments to report quarterly on the percentage of prime and subcontracts awarded to MBDA-certified minority business enterprises, with agency-specific targets established by OMB in coordination with the MBDA. Federal procurement represents approximately $700 billion annually — a pool of economic activity large enough to structurally change minority business revenue trajectories if procurement preferences are enforced with accountability.

### Reform VI: Census Bureau and Statistical Independence Protection

The independence of federal statistical agencies is a prerequisite for democratic self-governance. A government that controls its own measurement apparatus can manipulate perception of its performance. The administration will restore and institutionalize statistical independence through both executive action and legislation.

**Immediate Restoration:**

Reinstate all Census Bureau advisory committees eliminated by the prior administration, including the Census Advisory Committee and the National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic, and Other Populations. Restore all terminated Census surveys. Direct the Secretary of Commerce to prohibit any DOGE personnel from accessing Census Bureau microdata or survey operations without prior written authorization from the Census Bureau Director, consistent with 13 U.S.C. § 9 (confidentiality protections).

**2030 Decennial Preparation:**

The decennial census is a constitutional mandate. Direct the Census Bureau to begin operational planning for the 2030 census immediately, with attention to the recruitment and retention crisis documented in the 2025 Inspector General report. Fund the development and testing of new enumeration methodologies, including updated administrative record integration that improves coverage of hard-to-count populations — immigrants, people experiencing homelessness, young children — without compromising respondent confidentiality.

**BEA and Economic Data Independence:**

Direct the Bureau of Economic Analysis to implement a formal data release protocol that prohibits pre-release access to GDP, GDI, or national accounts data by any executive branch official outside the statistical release process. This protocol should be published in the Federal Register and modeled on the Federal Reserve's established pre-FOMC communication blackout rules.

---

### Reform VII: Export Controls Strategic Reform

The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the Export Administration Regulations, which are the primary legal instrument for preventing the transfer of U.S. technology to adversaries. The challenge is not the basic framework — it is enforcement gaps, transshipment vulnerabilities, and the need to modernize control lists for emerging technologies including AI hardware, quantum computing, and biotechnology.

**Transshipment Enforcement:**

The most significant gap in current semiconductor export controls is transshipment: restricted chips exported to ostensibly neutral third countries (Malaysia, Singapore, the UAE, Thailand) and then transferred to Chinese entities. Direct BIS to implement a mandatory end-user verification program for all exports of controlled semiconductor products above specified thresholds, requiring annual certification by foreign consignees and authorizing BIS auditors to conduct on-site verification visits. Expand the BIS enforcement staff by 200 positions dedicated to transshipment investigation.

**Emerging Technology Controls:**

Direct BIS to publish, within 180 days, a comprehensive review of the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) structure for AI training hardware, AI model weights, quantum computing components, and synthetic biology equipment — four categories where the current control architecture was designed for a different technological era. The review should assess whether new control categories are needed and whether current thresholds are calibrated appropriately.

**Allies and Coordination:**

Export controls are most effective when coordinated with allied export control regimes. Direct the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of State, to convene a Wassenaar Arrangement modernization initiative focused on synchronizing AI hardware and advanced semiconductor controls across U.S. allied nations. Unilateral controls without allied coordination create market distortions that disadvantage U.S. firms without achieving the security objectives.

### Reform VIII: NOAA Fisheries Restoration and Ocean Stewardship

NOAA Fisheries — the National Marine Fisheries Service — manages the fisheries of the United States exclusive economic zone, a resource worth approximately $244 billion to the U.S. economy annually and sustaining more than 1.7 million jobs. The same DOGE workforce purges that devastated the National Weather Service also thinned NOAA Fisheries staff, including the scientific teams responsible for stock assessments, the law enforcement officers who enforce at-sea regulations, and the habitat restoration program managers.

**Science-Based Fisheries Management:**

The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.) requires that fisheries management decisions be grounded in the best scientific information available. This requirement exists to protect both the fishery resource and the fishing industry — overfishing the stock destroys the commercial fishing sector as surely as the most punitive regulation. The administration will direct NOAA Fisheries to restore all scientific staff positions eliminated in 2025, accelerate the publication of delayed stock assessment reports, and restore full funding to the Regional Fishery Management Councils that develop fisheries management plans under Magnuson-Stevens authority.

**Aquaculture Development:**

The United States imports approximately 85 percent of its seafood, including from countries with documented environmental and labor standards violations. The Marine Aquaculture Action Plan, developed under the prior Biden administration and supported by the NOAA Aquaculture Program, provides the framework for expanding sustainable domestic aquaculture to reduce import dependence while creating American jobs. The administration will restore funding to the NOAA Aquaculture Program, direct NOAA and the Army Corps of Engineers to streamline the federal permitting process for offshore aquaculture installations, and establish a federal aquaculture development loan program through the Farm Credit System.

**Coastal and Habitat Restoration:**

NOAA's Office of Habitat Conservation administers the largest federal habitat restoration program focused on coastal, estuarine, and marine environments. Restored coastal wetlands and seagrass beds provide fish nursery habitat, storm surge protection, and carbon sequestration simultaneously — three distinct national goods from a single investment. The administration will restore the NOAA habitat restoration budget to pre-2025 levels and expand the Coastal Zone Management Act grant program (16 U.S.C. § 1451 et seq.) to address the accelerating impacts of sea level rise on coastal state economies.

### Reform IX: Spectrum Management and NTIA Modernization

The electromagnetic spectrum is a finite national resource worth trillions of dollars in economic value. The telecommunications industry, the aviation system, the national defense apparatus, the weather forecasting system, and an expanding universe of IoT devices all depend on access to allocated spectrum bands. NTIA manages federal government spectrum use and coordinates with the FCC on civilian spectrum allocation.

**Spectrum Auction Proceeds and Broadband:**

The administration will work with Congress to reauthorize and extend the FCC's spectrum auction authority — which has periodically lapsed, preventing the orderly realignment of spectrum from lower-value to higher-value uses — and to direct a portion of auction proceeds to fund BEAD program gap financing for underserved communities where BEAD funding alone is insufficient to make deployment financially viable for private operators.

**Federal Spectrum Efficiency:**

Direct NTIA to complete the comprehensive Federal Spectrum Efficiency Review that was begun but not completed during the prior administration, identifying spectrum bands currently held by federal agencies with significant underutilization that could be repurposed or shared with commercial operators through dynamic spectrum sharing arrangements. Federal agencies have historically treated spectrum allocations as permanent property rather than as managed public resources — an approach that sacrifices enormous economic value without commensurate public benefit.

**NextG Initiative and 6G Standards:**

The Next G Alliance, convened under the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions and supported by NTIA, coordinates U.S. private sector participation in the development of next-generation wireless technology standards. U.S. leadership in 5G standards was ceded partly to Huawei and European vendors because American companies did not participate actively in 3GPP standards bodies in the critical 2015-2020 period. The administration will establish a federal government commitment to supporting U.S. industry participation in 6G standards development through NTIA coordination funding, and will make 6G standards leadership a formal objective of the National Semiconductor Strategy.

---

### Reform X: USPTO Reform and Intellectual Property Integrity

The United States Patent and Trademark Office processes more than 600,000 patent applications annually and approximately 600,000 trademark applications, operating on user fees collected from applicants. The USPTO's fee structure was designed to make the office self-sustaining — but Congress has repeatedly diverted USPTO fee collections to other purposes, creating funding shortfalls that extend examination timelines and increase patent pendency.

**Fee Diversion Prohibition:**

Issue an executive order directing the Secretary of Commerce to certify to the Office of Management and Budget that all USPTO fee collections are retained and applied to USPTO operations, consistent with the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (35 U.S.C. § 42(c)). Propose legislation permanently prohibiting the diversion of USPTO user fees to non-USPTO purposes, removing the mechanism by which Congress has historically raided the patent system's operating funds.

**Patent Quality and Examination:**

Patent quality — the accuracy and reliability of the determination that an invention is novel, non-obvious, and adequately disclosed — is the foundation of the patent system's social bargain. A low-quality patent grants a monopoly the inventor did not earn and imposes costs on the public without commensurate innovation benefits. Direct the USPTO Director to implement a patent quality initiative, funded through restored fee revenues, that: increases examiner time-per-application for complex technology fields; expands the Prior Art Database to improve examiner access to existing literature; and establishes an enhanced inter partes review pathway for challenging low-quality patents that have been asserted offensively against small business defendants.

**Small Business and Inventor Access:**

The micro-entity and small-entity fee discount structure in the America Invents Act (35 U.S.C. § 41(h)) was designed to preserve patent system access for independent inventors and small firms who cannot match the patent filing volumes of large corporations. The administration will direct the USPTO to audit compliance with small-entity and micro-entity certifications, strengthen the fee waiver program for independent inventors, and establish a pro bono patent legal assistance program connecting law school clinics and volunteer patent attorneys with under-resourced inventors — particularly inventors from communities historically underrepresented in the patent system.

---

### Reform XI: Economic Development Administration Restoration and Expansion

The Economic Development Administration funds economic recovery in communities that market forces have left behind — deindustrialized manufacturing regions, rural agricultural communities, coal country, and disaster-affected areas. EDA's investment model — competitive grants for infrastructure, workforce development, and business incubation — has documented returns: every dollar of EDA investment generates approximately $16 in private investment over five years.

**Immediate Restoration:**

Restore EDA funding to pre-2025 levels, including all funds that were administratively frozen or reprogrammed by the prior administration. Reinstate all EDA staff separated through DOGE-directed workforce actions. Reopen all paused EDA grant competitions.

**Targeted Expansion:**

Establish a new EDA "Just Transition" grant program, funded at $2 billion over four years, specifically targeting communities that have experienced acute economic dislocation from the decline of fossil fuel industries. These communities — coal towns in Appalachia, oil and gas communities in the Permian Basin transition, refinery towns in the Gulf Coast — have existing workforce skills, infrastructure, and civic capacity that can be redirected with targeted investment.

**Rural Connectivity:**

Direct EDA to coordinate with NTIA's BEAD program so that broadband infrastructure grants are bundled with EDA economic development planning grants in rural communities, ensuring that new connectivity infrastructure is accompanied by business development assistance to generate economic activity on the new networks.
