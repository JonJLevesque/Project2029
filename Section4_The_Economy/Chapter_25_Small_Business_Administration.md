# Chapter 25: Small Business Administration

## Executive Summary

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is the federal government's primary institution for supporting the 33 million small businesses that employ 61 million Americans — nearly half the private-sector workforce. The SBA operates the 7(a) and 504 loan guarantee programs that channel hundreds of billions in capital to businesses that commercial banks will not fully finance, administers the SBIC venture capital program, processes disaster loans to businesses and homeowners following federal disaster declarations, manages the 8(a) Business Development program and contracting set-asides that reserve federal procurement for small, minority-owned, women-owned, veteran-owned, and HUBZone businesses, and funds the 1,000-center Small Business Development Center (SBDC) network and the SCORE mentorship program that collectively serve millions of entrepreneurs annually. The SBA is not a boutique agency; it is the backbone of American entrepreneurship, and its dysfunction has cascading consequences for the real economy.

Project 2025 and the Trump administration's DOGE initiative have systematically dismantled the SBA's capacity to perform any of these functions. A 43 percent workforce reduction — the elimination of approximately 2,700 of the agency's 6,500 employees — combined with the proposed elimination of 15 entrepreneurial development programs, the gutting of the 8(a) contracting program through race-neutral reinterpretation, and the imposition of ruinous tariffs on small business importers without any mitigation mechanism, has converted the SBA from an engine of small business growth into a skeleton agency incapable of executing its statutory mandate. Administrator Kelly Loeffler compounded the institutional damage by directing nonpartisan career employees to conduct partisan political activities in violation of the Hatch Act, transforming a neutral federal resource into an instrument of political messaging.

A future Democratic administration will restore the SBA to full operational capacity through workforce reconstruction, comprehensive disaster loan reform, strengthened equity contracting programs, targeted tariff relief for small importers, full funding restoration for SBDC and SCORE, expanded microloan access for underserved communities, and technology modernization of SBA loan processing infrastructure. The SBA will be rebuilt not merely as it was, but as it should have been: faster, better capitalized, more equitable, and structurally insulated from political manipulation.

**The Stakes**: Thirty-three million small businesses generate 44 percent of U.S. economic activity. Entrepreneurs in rural communities, communities of color, and working-class neighborhoods depend on SBA programs because they are shut out of conventional capital markets. When the SBA collapses, those businesses do not get loans from JPMorgan Chase instead — they close. The DOGE gutting of the SBA is not a government efficiency measure; it is a transfer of market share from Main Street to the large corporations and private equity firms that need no federal assistance. Reversing this damage is both an economic imperative and a matter of democratic equity.

**Key Reforms**:
- Restore SBA to full staffing — reinstate the approximately 2,700 employees eliminated by DOGE, and establish statutory staffing floors in the SBA Workforce Stability Act
- Rebuild disaster loan processing capacity with dedicated surge workforce, 21-day processing targets, and pre-positioned financing authority to prevent funding lapses
- Restore and strengthen the 8(a) Business Development program, reverse the race-neutral reinterpretation that reduced new program admissions from 2,100 per year to 65, and reinstate the 15 percent Small Disadvantaged Business contracting goal
- Establish the Small Business Tariff Relief Fund to reimburse small importers for documented tariff costs exceeding 10 percent of gross revenue
- Restore full congressional appropriations for SBDC ($155 million annually), SCORE ($17 million), Women's Business Centers (150+ centers), and Veterans Business Outreach Centers (34 locations)
- Double the SBA Microloan Program's annual lending authority to $140 million and expand eligibility to include first-generation entrepreneurs without credit history
- Launch the Main Street Equity Capital Initiative, modeled on the SBIC program, to direct $5 billion in equity and quasi-equity capital to women-owned, minority-owned, and rural small businesses over four years
- Modernize SBA loan processing technology to eliminate the paper-based application backlog and achieve full digital processing by Year 2
- Establish the Office of Small Business Economic Security within the SBA to monitor and report on macroeconomic threats to small businesses, including tariff impacts, supply chain disruptions, and credit tightening
- Refer all unresolved PPP and EIDL fraud cases to the Department of Justice and restore SBA Inspector General independence and funding

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. § 631 et seq.); Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. § 661 et seq.); Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-240); American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Pub. L. 117-2); Women's Business Centers authorization (15 U.S.C. § 656); Microloan Program (15 U.S.C. § 636(m)); Commerce Clause (U.S. Const. art.

## Part I: Project 2025 SBA Damage and Destruction

### Damage Area 1: The DOGE Workforce Demolition

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The Department of Government Efficiency, operating through SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler, executed a two-phase destruction of the SBA workforce. On February 7, 2025, the SBA transmitted termination notices to hundreds of probationary employees across the United States with no transition planning, no knowledge transfer, and no assessment of the operational impact on pending loan applications and disaster relief cases. This was not a targeted reduction of underperforming staff — it was an across-the-board termination of the most recently hired, most diverse segment of the federal workforce, disproportionately eliminating employees in field offices that serve rural and underserved communities.

On March 21, 2025, Administrator Loeffler announced the second phase: elimination of 2,700 active positions out of a total workforce of approximately 6,500, a 43 percent reduction. Bloomberg reported the announcement; congressional Democrats condemned it as a deliberate effort to incapacitate the agency. The Center for American Progress documented that the cuts would directly impair disaster loan processing, 7(a) loan guarantee underwriting, SBDC grant administration, contracting program oversight, and women's business center coordination.

The personnel losses fell unevenly on the programs serving the most vulnerable businesses. District office staff who counsel entrepreneurs in-person were disproportionately eliminated. Loan processing officers handling the post-disaster application backlog from Hurricanes Helene and Milton were terminated while their caseloads remained pending. The DOGE workforce demolition was not efficiency — it was sabotage dressed in the language of fiscal restraint.

**The Hatch Act Violations:**

Administrator Loeffler directed nonpartisan career employees to place partisan political messaging in their official out-of-office email responses and on SBA district office answering machines during the October 2025 government shutdown — conduct that constitutes a clear violation of the Hatch Act, 5 U.S.C. § 7323, which prohibits executive branch employees from using their official authority to interfere with the outcome of elections or to engage in political activity while on duty. The Public Citizen watchdog organization filed a formal Hatch Act complaint. Senator Edward Markey, Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee, sent Loeffler a formal demand letter citing the conduct as illegal. The SBA under Loeffler's direction converted a nonpartisan federal institution into a tool of partisan political messaging — a fundamental breach of the agency's statutory mandate.

### Damage Area 2: Disaster Loan Program Collapse

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The SBA's disaster loan program is the federal government's primary mechanism for helping homeowners and small businesses recover from natural disasters. The program nearly collapsed in 2024-2025 under the combined weight of inadequate appropriations and the Trump administration's workforce reductions.

The SBA exhausted its disaster loan program funding on October 15, 2024. From October 15 through December 21, 2024 — a 68-day lapse — the SBA could not issue new loan offers to any applicant. During that period, more than 21,000 individuals and businesses affected by Hurricanes Milton and Helene, and more than 200 other federally declared disasters, were frozen in a processing backlog. As CBS News reported, the SBA "ran out of funding for disaster relief loans after hurricanes Helene and Milton." Although the agency was processing applications in an average of 17 days during the lapse, it could not disburse loans.

The American Relief Act of 2025, signed by President Biden on December 21, 2024, restored disaster loan funding and allowed the SBA to process the backlog. But the underlying structural failure — insufficient pre-positioned disaster loan authority and a workforce unable to surge in response to major disasters — was not corrected. The subsequent DOGE workforce reductions made the structural problem dramatically worse. A disaster loan program that requires months of congressional action to restore funding after each major storm is not a disaster relief system; it is a bureaucratic delay mechanism that forces the most vulnerable communities to wait the longest.

The April 2025 extension of the Hurricane Helene and Milton application deadline to April 27, 2025 — more than six months after the storms struck — reflected the administrative collapse of a program that was supposed to provide emergency economic stabilization. Businesses that waited six months for loan decisions did not pause operations; they closed.

---

### Damage Area 3: Dismantling Equity Contracting Programs

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The 8(a) Business Development program, authorized under the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. § 636(j), is the federal government's primary mechanism for building the capacity of small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The program allows eligible firms to compete for set-aside federal contracts, provides mentoring and business development support, and creates a pathway to federal market access for entrepreneurs who face systemic barriers in commercial markets.

The Trump administration, responding to court decisions hostile to race-conscious programs, directed the SBA to administer the 8(a) program on a fully race-neutral basis — eliminating the presumption of social disadvantage for members of named minority groups that had long provided the practical foundation for the program's operation. The result was catastrophic for program access. During the Biden administration, the SBA admitted more than 2,100 new firms per year into the 8(a) program. Under the Trump SBA, that number collapsed to 65 new admissions in 2025 — a 97 percent reduction.

The SBA simultaneously reset the Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) governmentwide contracting goal from 15 percent — the Biden administration target — to 5 percent, assigning every federal agency the same baseline goal regardless of prior performance or the composition of their vendor pool. This reduction directly reduced the market opportunity available to minority-owned small businesses across all federal procurement.

Administrator Loeffler ordered a "full-scale audit" of the 8(a) program in June 2025 — framing a functioning equity program as a presumptive fraud risk while the SBA simultaneously terminated the staff responsible for program oversight and compliance. The audit was a mechanism for delay and disruption, not accountability.

The Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contracting Program and the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) program faced analogous pressures from budget cuts and staff reductions, undermining the federal government's capacity to meet the contracting goals for these categories required under the Small Business Act.

---

### Damage Area 4: Tariff Imposition Without Small Business Mitigation

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025's trade agenda called for aggressive tariff escalation — including 60 percent tariffs on Chinese imports and broad tariffs on other trading partners — without any mechanism to protect the small businesses that would bear the cost. Small businesses represent 97 percent of all U.S. importers. Unlike large corporations with sophisticated supply chain management, diverse sourcing options, and the financial reserves to absorb cost shocks, small business importers operate on narrow margins, have limited leverage with suppliers, and cannot pass costs to consumers without losing business.

The consequence has been documented and severe. A Center for American Progress analysis published in December 2025 found that small business importers were paying approximately $25,000 more per month in tariff costs since April 2025. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees paid on average more than $86,000 more per business during the April-September 2025 period than in the prior year. A Small Business Majority survey in late 2025 found that 74 percent of small business owners were worried about their business surviving the next 12 months.

The SBA under the Trump administration established no tariff relief program, no targeted working capital bridge loan for small importers absorbing tariff costs, and no counseling program to help small businesses navigate tariff exemption processes. The SBA that was supposed to be the voice of Main Street inside the federal government was instead an instrument of the administration that imposed the tariffs. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees laid off 120,000 workers in November 2025 alone — the highest small-business layoff figure in five years.

### Damage Area 5: PPP and EIDL Fraud Accountability Abandoned

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, enacted under the CARES Act (Pub. L. 116-136) and subsequent legislation, distributed approximately $1.2 trillion to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The programs operated at unprecedented speed under enormous pressure, and the fraud that resulted was correspondingly unprecedented. GAO and SBA Inspector General reports documented that billions of dollars were disbursed to fraudulent applicants, shell entities, and ineligible recipients.

The Biden administration made significant progress in fraud referral and prosecution: as of the end of 2023, more than 2,393 defendants had been found guilty of fraud-related charges involving pandemic relief programs, and civil and criminal cases resulted in the forfeiture of more than $1 billion in fraudulent proceeds. The SBA OIG and GAO continued to identify cases requiring follow-up action through 2025.

The Trump administration disrupted this accountability infrastructure in two compounding ways. First, DOGE workforce reductions eliminated SBA employees involved in ongoing fraud reviews, including those administering the hold code review process for flagged PPP loans. SBA OIG Report 25-12 documented that SBA had not completed its review process for 37,938 PPP loans totaling approximately $4.6 billion that had been flagged with hold code 70 for potential clawback — and that SBA had completed only the first two of four required review steps for these cases. Second, the politicization of the SBA introduced confusion and delay into referral processes, as agency leadership prioritized political messaging over systematic fraud recovery.

The administration's approach to PPP fraud accountability was selective and political. Administrator Loeffler announced in December 2025 that the SBA was pausing annual funding to Minnesota pending investigation of $430 million in suspected PPP fraud — a decision announced with explicit reference to Governor Tim Walz's tenure, framing a law enforcement matter as a political attack. Simultaneously, the broader fraud referral program lost staff and momentum, leaving billions in potentially recoverable fraud proceeds unpursued.

The GAO documented in GAO-25-107267 that the Inspector General was unable to fully investigate nearly 2 million of the 3 million fraud referrals because SBA had not provided sufficient or accurate information in its referrals — a systemic failure of information management that the DOGE workforce reduction made impossible to correct.

---

### The Human Cost

The aggregate impact of DOGE workforce destruction, disaster loan collapse, equity contracting retrenchment, and tariff harm falls most heavily on the Americans who have the least access to alternative capital markets and the fewest resources to withstand economic disruption.

Minority-owned small businesses — which received 8(a) support at 97 percent lower rates in 2025 compared to the Biden years — operate in communities where conventional bank financing has historically been unavailable. Women-owned businesses, which the WOSB program was designed to bring into federal contracting markets, face renewed exclusion. Veterans who built businesses under SDVOSB preferences face procurement market constriction from staff reductions that impair contracting program administration. Rural small businesses that depend on SBA-backed lending and SBDC technical assistance face compounded harm from staff reductions in field offices that serve less-populated regions.

The proposed FY 2026 budget, if enacted, would eliminate 15 entrepreneurial development programs — closing more than 150 Women's Business Centers, 250 SCORE chapters, and 31 Veterans Business Outreach Centers. More than 300,000 small business owners served by SCORE annually would lose access to mentorship. The SBDC network, which serves millions of clients per year through 1,000 centers across all 50 states and territories, faces funding cuts that would eliminate field counseling for the entrepreneurs who need it most.

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

Congress derives authority to establish and fund the Small Business Administration from the Commerce Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3), which grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states — authority that the Supreme Court has consistently interpreted to encompass the full range of commercial activity, including the provision of federal loan guarantees and business development assistance that affects interstate commerce. The Spending Clause (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1) authorizes Congress to appropriate funds for the general welfare, and the SBA's programs plainly serve that purpose by sustaining the small business sector that constitutes nearly half the American economy. The federal procurement authority, grounded in the Property Clause (U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2) and implemented through statutes including 41 U.S.C. § 3901 et seq., provides independent constitutional grounding for set-aside contracting programs.

The executive branch's authority to structure and operate the SBA within congressional authorization is well-established. What is not authorized is the executive branch's unilateral dismantling of statutory programs through budget impoundment, personnel elimination, or administrative reinterpretation — conduct that implicates the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq.) and the Administrative Procedure Act's prohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)).

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. § 631 et seq.)**: The foundational statute establishing the SBA, its mission, and its primary programs. Section 7(a) (15 U.S.C. § 636(a)) authorizes the loan guarantee program. Section 7(b) (15 U.S.C. § 636(b)) authorizes disaster loans. Section 7(j) and 8(a) (15 U.S.C. §§ 636(j), 637(a)) authorize the Business Development and contracting assistance programs for socially and economically disadvantaged businesses. Section 8(d) (15 U.S.C. § 637(d)) authorizes subcontracting assistance plans.

**Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. § 661 et seq.)**: Authorizes the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, through which the SBA licenses and regulates privately owned and managed investment companies that provide equity capital and long-term loans to small businesses.

**Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-240)**: Expanded SBA loan limits, created the Small Business Lending Fund, and strengthened contracting programs including WOSB contracting authority.

**Women's Business Centers Authorization (15 U.S.C. § 656)**: Directs the SBA to fund a national network of Women's Business Centers providing counseling, training, and technical assistance.

**Microloan Program (15 U.S.C. § 636(m))**: Authorizes the SBA to provide direct loans to intermediary lenders, which in turn provide microloans of up to $50,000 to very small businesses and startup entrepreneurs.

**Hatch Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 7321-7326)**: Prohibits federal executive branch employees from engaging in partisan political activity while on duty or in the federal workplace. Administrator Loeffler's direction to employees to place partisan political messaging in official communications violated this statute.

**Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. § 681 et seq.)**: Prohibits the executive branch from refusing to obligate or spend funds duly appropriated by Congress. The SBA's reported blocking of congressional appropriations for SBDC, SCORE, WBCs, and VBOCs — as documented by the Senate Small Business Committee — constitutes unlawful impoundment.

### Federal Procurement Legal Framework

The Small Business Act's contracting provisions, including the 8(a) program and the WOSB, SDVOSB, and HUBZone programs, operate within the federal procurement framework established by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R. Parts 1-99, and the applicable SBA regulations at 13 C.F.R. Parts 119-128. The governmentwide statutory small business contracting goals — 23 percent for small businesses overall, 5 percent for small disadvantaged businesses (with the Biden-era aspirational goal of 15 percent), 5 percent for WOSBs, 3 percent for SDVOSBs, and 3 percent for HUBZone firms — are established by 15 U.S.C. § 644.

The Supreme Court's decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, 600 U.S. 181 (2023), addressed race-conscious admissions in higher education under the Equal Protection Clause. That decision did not reach federal contracting programs, which rest on a distinct constitutional foundation — Congress's Spending Clause authority and the federal procurement power — and which the Court has addressed in a separate line of cases including Adarand Constructors v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), requiring strict scrutiny but not prohibiting narrowly tailored race-conscious contracting programs. The Trump administration's administrative reinterpretation of the 8(a) program goes beyond what any court has required and reflects a political choice, not a legal mandate.

---

## Part III: Comprehensive SBA Restoration and Reform

### The 7(a) and 504 Loan Programs: The Core of SBA Capital Access

Before addressing the DOGE damage and the reform agenda, the scale of what was put at risk requires context. The SBA 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program is the agency's flagship and the primary federal mechanism through which small businesses access long-term capital for real estate, equipment, working capital, and business acquisition. In fiscal year 2023, the SBA approved approximately 57,000 7(a) loans totaling more than $27 billion. The loan guarantee — under which the SBA guarantees up to 85 percent of loans up to $150,000 and 75 percent of loans above that threshold — allows participating lenders to extend credit to borrowers who lack the collateral or credit history required for conventional financing. Without this guarantee, most 7(a) borrowers would not receive financing at all.

The SBA 504 Loan Program, administered through Certified Development Companies (CDCs), provides long-term, fixed-rate financing for major fixed assets — land, buildings, and equipment — that promote business growth and job creation. 504 loans are structured as a combination of private lender financing (50 percent), CDC debenture backed by an SBA guarantee (40 percent), and borrower equity (10 percent). The program is particularly valuable for small manufacturers and businesses in capital-intensive industries that require real estate or heavy equipment to operate.

Both programs depend on staffed SBA loan processing centers, active lender relationships, and functioning underwriting operations. The DOGE workforce reduction — which eliminated approximately 2,700 of 6,500 SBA employees — directly impaired these operations. Loan processing times increased, lender coordination deteriorated, and thousands of pending applications faced extended delays at precisely the moment when small business borrowers, already strained by tariff costs and economic uncertainty, most needed capital access. The SBA's core function — channeling credit to businesses that commercial markets will not fully serve — was deliberately incapacitated.

---

### Reform I: SBA Workforce Restoration and Institutional Stability

The restoration of the SBA begins with people. The next Democratic administration will issue an executive order within the first 30 days directing the SBA to initiate competitive reinstatement offers to all employees terminated through DOGE workforce reductions between January 20, 2025 and the date of the order. Reinstatement will be prioritized for disaster loan processing officers, field office counselors, contracting program specialists, and women's business center coordinators — the positions whose elimination most directly impaired agency operations.

Beyond reinstatement, Congress must enact the SBA Workforce Stability Act establishing a statutory minimum staffing floor for the SBA at 90 percent of the January 19, 2025 full-time equivalent count, subject to upward adjustment by the SBA Administrator based on loan volume, disaster declarations, and program demand. Any reduction below the statutory floor will require advance notification to Congress and a 60-day review period. This provision codifies in statute what executive norms failed to protect against.

The SBA will establish a career development and succession planning infrastructure for loan processing, disaster relief, and contracting specialists — functions that require years of institutional knowledge to perform competently and that cannot be rebuilt quickly after mass termination. The agency will implement an internal knowledge management system to capture and preserve institutional expertise.

The SBA Inspector General's office, which was impaired by the broader pattern of political interference, will receive a budget restoration to pre-2025 levels and statutory independence protections including a prohibition on the SBA Administrator directing or limiting Inspector General investigations.

---

### Reform II: Disaster Loan Program Overhaul

The SBA disaster loan program's vulnerability to funding lapses and processing backlogs is a structural failure that the next administration will fix through systemic reform, not temporary patches.

The administration will work with Congress to establish a Disaster Loan Revolving Fund — a permanently appropriated, revolving credit facility that automatically replenishes from disaster loan repayments and maintains a minimum balance sufficient to process 90 days of projected disaster loan demand at historical disaster frequency. This fund eliminates the October 2024 scenario where the SBA had applications pending but no legal authority to disburse funds. The revolving fund is modeled on the Export-Import Bank's authority structure and operates through permanent appropriation rather than annual discretionary funding.

The SBA will establish a National Disaster Loan Surge Capacity program, maintaining pre-qualified contracts with staffing agencies and retired SBA loan officers to provide surge capacity within 72 hours of a major disaster declaration. The agency currently lacks formal surge mechanisms; when disasters occur, it attempts to redeploy existing staff while those staff continue handling pre-disaster workloads. The surge capacity program creates a dedicated reserve that activates automatically upon declaration.

The administration will impose a 21-day processing standard for disaster loan applications, with SBA required to report to Congress monthly on its performance against that standard. Applications that remain unprocessed after 21 days will trigger an automatic status notification to the applicant and an internal escalation review. The standard will be enforced through appropriations conditions in annual SBA funding legislation.

Digital modernization of disaster loan intake and processing will eliminate paper applications. The SBA will implement a fully digital application portal, automated document verification, and electronic loan servicing by the end of Year 1. Digital processing will reduce processing time, reduce error rates, and allow remote processing by surge staff.

---

### Reform III: Restoring and Strengthening Equity Contracting Programs

The collapse of the 8(a) program — from 2,100 new admissions annually to 65 — is an administrative choice that the next administration will reverse. The SBA will restore the pre-2025 8(a) application and admissions process, including the presumptions of social disadvantage for members of named groups, consistent with applicable law and supported by the comprehensive congressional and agency findings of documented discrimination that provide the constitutional foundation for the program under Adarand Constructors v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995).

The administration will direct the SBA to issue new regulations under 13 C.F.R. Part 124 restoring the presumption of social disadvantage as a rebuttable presumption, supported by updated agency findings that document current barriers faced by minority entrepreneurs in capital markets, federal contracting, and business formation. These findings will be comprehensive, current, and legally defensible.

The governmentwide Small Disadvantaged Business contracting goal will be restored to 15 percent, with the SBA working with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to develop agency-specific implementation plans that account for differences in contract mix and vendor pool composition. Agencies will be required to report quarterly on progress toward SDB goals, and the SBA will publish the data publicly.

The Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contracting Program will be strengthened through increased WOSB certification funding, expedited certification processing (target: 30 days from complete application), and a 6 percent WOSB contracting goal across the federal government. The Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business program will receive parallel strengthening, with a 4 percent contracting goal and expedited certification for veterans with documented service-connected disabilities.

The SBA will establish the Equity Contracting Assistance Initiative, a dedicated program providing pre-certification counseling and technical assistance to minority-owned, women-owned, and veteran-owned small businesses seeking entry into federal contracting markets. The initiative will be operated through the existing SBDC network, with dedicated contracting specialists at each center.

---

### Reform IV: Small Business Tariff Relief and Trade Impact Mitigation

The next administration will establish the Small Business Tariff Relief Program, authorized under the Small Business Act and funded through an emergency supplemental appropriation, to provide direct relief to small business importers bearing disproportionate tariff costs. The program will function as follows:

Small businesses with fewer than 500 employees that demonstrate that tariff costs on U.S.-origin or third-country-origin imports exceed 10 percent of annual gross revenue will be eligible for reimbursement of 50 percent of documented excess tariff costs, up to $150,000 per business per year. Applications will be processed through SBA district offices within 60 days. The program will be funded at $2 billion annually for the first two years, drawn from the General Fund pursuant to specific appropriation.

The SBA will establish a Tariff Navigation Assistance program, operated through SBDCs and SCORE, providing specialized counseling on tariff classification, exemption applications, supply chain diversification, and domestic sourcing alternatives. The program will hire dedicated trade specialists at the 10 SBA regional offices and fund training for SBDC counselors in tariff compliance and exemption procedures.

The SBA Administrator will establish an Office of Small Business Trade Advocacy within the existing agency structure to represent small business interests in interagency trade policy deliberations, including in the United States Trade Representative's Section 301 exclusion process and any future tariff negotiation frameworks. This office will provide the SBA with a formal seat at the table in trade policy discussions that currently proceed with no structural mechanism for small business input.

The administration will also direct the SBA to develop, within 180 days, an Emergency Working Capital Loan program specifically available to small businesses facing sudden cost shocks from trade policy changes, with streamlined underwriting, 90-day application processing, and interest rates capped at prime plus 2 percent.

---

### Reform V: SBDC, SCORE, WBC, and VBOC Funding Restoration

The administration will move immediately to release all congressionally appropriated funding for SBA entrepreneurial development programs that was blocked or impounded during the Trump administration. The SBA Administrator will issue a written directive within the first week of the new administration requiring the release of all obligated but undisbursed SBDC, SCORE, WBC, and VBOC grants within 15 business days.

Congressional appropriations targets will be established as follows:
- Small Business Development Centers: $155 million annually, sufficient to fund all 63 Lead Centers and their approximately 1,000 service locations at current operational levels with inflation adjustment
- SCORE: $17 million annually, restoring the program to pre-2025 funding with a 5 percent annual increase indexed to program demand
- Women's Business Centers: $50 million annually, restoring and expanding the network from its current contracted state to 175 centers
- Veterans Business Outreach Centers: $15 million annually, maintaining the full network of 34 VBOCs

Beyond restoration, the administration will propose the Entrepreneurship Infrastructure Investment Act to provide a one-time $500 million capital investment in the SBDC and WBC networks for technology upgrades, expanded counselor training, translation and language access services, and physical expansion into underserved rural and urban communities that currently lack a nearby SBDC service location.

---

### Reform VI: Microloan Program Expansion and Underserved Community Capital Access

The SBA Microloan Program, authorized under 15 U.S.C. § 636(m), provides loans of up to $50,000 through nonprofit intermediary lenders to very small businesses, startup entrepreneurs, and businesses in underserved communities. The program is structurally suited to serve the entrepreneurs who most lack access to conventional capital — first-generation business owners, recent immigrants, entrepreneurs in low-income communities, and individuals without traditional credit histories — but it has been chronically underfunded relative to demand.

The administration will propose legislation to double the Microloan Program's annual lending authority to $140 million, with expanded eligibility criteria that explicitly include entrepreneurs without traditional credit histories, provided they demonstrate business viability through alternative underwriting criteria including cash flow analysis, business plan evaluation, and character references from community organizations. The maximum microloan amount will be increased from $50,000 to $75,000 to reflect two decades of inflation since the limit was last substantially adjusted.

The administration will establish a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Partnership Program within the SBA, formalizing and expanding the existing relationships between SBA-licensed microloan intermediaries and CDFIs to co-originate loans that exceed the SBA microloan limit but fall below the threshold for 7(a) guarantee. This bridge financing program will close the gap in the capital market between microloans and SBA-guaranteed bank loans where thousands of small businesses currently fall through.

Technical assistance funding attached to microloan intermediaries will be increased by $25 million annually, recognizing that the technical assistance component of the microloan program — business planning support, financial literacy training, and ongoing counseling — is as important as the capital itself for the entrepreneurs the program serves.

---

### Reform VII: PPP and EIDL Fraud Recovery and Inspector General Independence

The unfinished business of pandemic loan fraud recovery represents both a legal obligation and a fiscal opportunity. The next administration will establish a dedicated Pandemic Loan Fraud Recovery Task Force within the SBA, staffed by additional Inspector General personnel and operating in coordination with the Department of Justice, to systematically complete the four-step hold code review process for all 37,938 flagged PPP loans totaling approximately $4.6 billion in potential clawback. The Task Force will have a five-year mandate, dedicated funding of $150 million drawn from recoveries, and authority to refer all substantiated cases to the Department of Justice within 30 days of review completion.

The SBA Inspector General will receive permanent statutory independence protections: the SBA Administrator will be prohibited from directing, limiting, or delaying Inspector General investigations; the Inspector General will have independent litigation authority; the Inspector General budget will be set at a statutory floor of 3 percent of SBA program budget, subject to upward appropriation; and the Inspector General will report directly to Congress on an unimpeded basis. These protections mirror those established for the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) and are appropriate given the SBA's history of programmatic vulnerability to both fraud and political interference.

The politicization of the PPP fraud enforcement process — the use of fraud referrals as a political weapon against Democratic governors while systematically abandoning the broader recovery effort — will be formally investigated. The SBA Inspector General will conduct a comprehensive review of all decisions to pause, delay, or announce fraud referrals during the Trump administration's first term and report findings to Congress within 180 days.

### Reform VIII: Rural Small Business and Agricultural Community Support

Small businesses in rural America face a compounded set of challenges: geographic isolation from capital markets, thinner local customer bases, limited broadband infrastructure that restricts digital commerce, higher transportation costs, and SBDC field office closures that eliminated the technical assistance previously available to rural entrepreneurs. The Trump administration's SBA workforce reductions disproportionately affected rural field offices, where staffing was already thin and the loss of even a single loan officer or SBDC coordinator had immediate and direct operational consequences.

The next administration will establish a Rural Small Business Initiative within the SBA, consolidating and expanding existing programs — including the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), the Value-Added Producer Grants program, and USDA-SBA coordination mechanisms — into a coherent rural entrepreneurship strategy. The initiative will target five priority areas:

**Rural Capital Access**: Expand the SBA's Community Advantage Loan Program (formerly SBLC), which enables Community Development Lenders to make SBA-backed loans to underserved markets including rural areas, with increased guarantee percentages and streamlined underwriting for loans below $350,000 in rural census tracts. Fund rural-focused microloan intermediaries in areas with limited CDFI presence.

**Rural SBDC Expansion**: Fund the creation of 50 new Rural SBDC service locations in counties that currently lack a service location within 50 miles, with dedicated rural business counselors trained in agricultural enterprise, agritourism, rural hospitality, and remote-work business development.

**Rural Broadband Business Development**: Partner with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to ensure that rural businesses receiving SBA financing in broadband-underserved areas have access to complementary technical assistance for digital commerce and remote customer acquisition.

**Rural Manufacturing and Supply Chain**: Establish a Rural Manufacturing Loan Program within the 7(a) framework, providing enhanced guarantee rates (90 percent) for manufacturing businesses in rural counties that demonstrate job creation of at least 3 full-time equivalent positions per loan.

**Agricultural Small Business Export Support**: Work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Export Assistance Centers to provide SBA export working capital loans to small agricultural processors and food manufacturers seeking to access international markets, with counseling available through SBDCs in agricultural states.

### Reform IX: Main Street Equity Capital Initiative and Venture Access

The SBA Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, authorized under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, licenses and regulates privately managed venture capital and private equity funds that receive SBA-guaranteed debentures, allowing them to leverage private capital with federal backing to invest in small businesses. The SBIC program currently deploys approximately $4-5 billion annually.

The administration will launch the Main Street Equity Capital Initiative — a targeted SBIC sub-program specifically for funds that commit to deploying at least 50 percent of invested capital in women-owned, minority-owned, and rural small businesses. Participating funds will receive enhanced SBA leverage ratios (3:1 rather than the standard 2:1), reduced licensing fees, and streamlined regulatory examination. The initiative will target $5 billion in total investment over four years.

The SBA will establish the First-Time Fund Manager Program, modeled on initiatives developed by the Small Business Majority and advocated by Congressional Democrats, to reduce barriers to SBIC licensing for diverse and first-time fund managers. The program will provide pre-licensing technical assistance, expedited review for funds below $100 million in committed capital, and a dedicated SBA liaison for first-time managers navigating the licensing process.

The SBA will partner with the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve's Community Reinvestment Act framework to ensure that banks and credit unions are providing small business loans in historically underserved markets, creating complementary data collection and reporting that allows the SBA to target its programs toward the geographies and demographic groups where conventional market failure is most severe.
