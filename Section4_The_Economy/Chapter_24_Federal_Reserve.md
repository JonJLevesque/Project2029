# Chapter 24: Federal Reserve System

## Executive Summary

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States, established by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (12 U.S.C. § 221 et seq.) and fundamentally reshaped by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq.). Its dual mandate — maximum employment and stable prices — is codified in the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. § 3101), commonly called the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. The Fed operates through a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets monetary policy. It maintains a balance sheet exceeding $7 trillion, supervises more than 900 bank holding companies and state member banks, serves as the lender of last resort for the U.S. banking system, and operates the nation's payment infrastructure. The Federal Reserve is one of the most consequential institutions on earth, and its independence from day-to-day political control is not an abstract principle — it is the structural guarantee that interest rate decisions serve economic conditions rather than electoral calendars.

The Trump administration and the architects of Project 2025 have attacked Federal Reserve independence on every front simultaneously. Trump publicly called Fed Chair Jerome Powell a "jerk," a "numbskull," and "a very stupid person" across dozens of posts and public statements, demanding rate cuts to match his political timeline rather than economic conditions. The administration explored firing Powell — an act that would trigger a constitutional crisis and a market collapse — before ultimately declining reappointment rather than risking a direct confrontation. In January 2026, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas threatening a criminal indictment against Powell over testimony related to a building renovation — a transparently pretextual escalation designed to coerce interest rate policy through prosecutorial intimidation. Meanwhile, Project 2025's formal policy blueprint (pages 696–703) calls for abolishing the Federal Reserve entirely, returning to "free banking," eliminating the lender-of-last-resort function, and exploring a return to the gold standard. The administration rescinded the 2023 Community Reinvestment Act rule, reversed climate risk supervisory principles, banned development of a central bank digital currency, and is actively pursuing reversal of Humphrey's Executor v. United States (1935) — the foundational Supreme Court precedent protecting independent agency leadership from political removal.

This chapter charts a comprehensive program to restore, protect, and strengthen the Federal Reserve: statutory guardrails against political interference, legislative codification of Fed Chair removal standards, a strengthened dual mandate prioritizing full employment, robust CRA enforcement to reverse discriminatory lending patterns, climate risk integration into bank supervision, a digital dollar framework that serves public interest, and structural reforms to the regional Federal Reserve Bank governance to eliminate private banking industry capture.

**The Stakes**: The Federal Reserve's independence is the institutional guarantee that monetary policy serves the whole economy — workers, families, and small businesses — rather than the preferences of the sitting president or the desires of large financial institutions. When a president can coerce interest rate cuts through public harassment, threatened termination, or fabricated criminal prosecution, monetary policy becomes a political instrument. Inflation expectations become unanchored. Long-term interest rates rise as investors price in political risk. The dollar weakens. Every American who holds a mortgage, carries credit card debt, runs a small business, or saves for retirement pays the price. The fight for Fed independence is not abstract — it is a fight over who controls the cost of money and who bears the consequences.

**Key Reforms**:
- Enact statutory protections for Federal Reserve Board of Governors members specifying that removal requires proof of "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office," eliminating executive ambiguity
- Strengthen and expand the Fed's full employment mandate, requiring specific FOMC reporting on racial and geographic employment gaps
- Restore and expand the 2023 Community Reinvestment Act rule, mandate fair lending enforcement, and require CRA examination ratings for Fed-supervised institutions
- Require integration of climate-related financial risk into all Federal Reserve supervisory and stress-testing frameworks
- Establish a Federal Reserve Digital Payments Act authorizing development of a central bank digital currency and a digital dollar pilot program serving unbanked and underbanked Americans
- Reform regional Federal Reserve Bank governance to eliminate Class A director positions controlled by commercial banks, replacing them with publicly-appointed community representatives
- Expand FedNow instant payment infrastructure to reach all financial institutions, credit unions, and community banks by 2027
- Establish a Federal Reserve Racial Economic Equity Office with authority to incorporate racial employment and wealth gap data into FOMC deliberations
- Codify Fed supervisory authority over systemically important financial institutions and reverse Dodd-Frank rollbacks executed by the Trump administration
- Protect the lender-of-last-resort function from political interference by requiring congressional notification — not approval — for emergency lending facilities

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 221 et seq.); Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act (15 U.S.C. § 3101); Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq.); Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. § 1841); Community Reinvestment Act (12 U.S.C. § 2901); Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (12 U.S.C. § 2801); Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1811); *Humphrey's Executor v. United States*, 295 U.S. 602 (1935); *Seila Law LLC v. CFPB*, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 5 (Coinage Clause); Art. I, § 8, cl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause).

## Part I: Project 2025 Federal Reserve Damage and Threats

### Damage Area 1: The Campaign to Destroy Fed Independence Through Political Coercion

**What Project 2025 Did and What the Trump Administration Executed:**

The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint (pages 696–703) did not merely propose policy adjustments to Federal Reserve operations. It proposed eliminating the Federal Reserve entirely. Written by Trump administration economist Paul Winfree, the Project 2025 chapter on monetary policy calls for replacing the Fed with a system of "free banking" — a nineteenth-century model in which individual private banks issue their own currency without a central monetary authority. The document argues that the Great Depression was caused by the Federal Reserve's "inept management of the money supply," that economic downturns recur every five years due to the "impossibility of fine-tuning the money supply in real-time," and that the Fed's lender-of-last-resort function amplifies "moral hazard" by providing emergency support to failing institutions.

These are not mainstream economic arguments. They are fringe Austrian School positions that would — if implemented — eliminate the institutional mechanism that prevented the 2008 financial crisis from becoming a second Great Depression, end deposit insurance backstopping that protects ordinary savers, and return monetary policy to the uncoordinated chaos of the pre-1913 era, when financial panics occurred roughly every decade. The Project 2025 proposal also includes exploring a return to the gold standard, which would strip the federal government of the ability to use monetary policy to respond to recessions at all.

The Trump administration, in practice, chose a path of coercion rather than outright abolition — but the coercion was systematic and escalating. President Trump publicly attacked Powell across dozens of statements throughout 2025, calling him a "jerk," a "numbskull," and demanding that Powell cut interest rates to match the president's political preferences. Trump told Republican lawmakers he was considering whether to fire Powell. Markets responded to these threats: the S&P 500 dropped sharply on reports of firing discussions, and the dollar weakened as investors priced in political risk to monetary policy. In July 2025, Trump stated Powell should resign "immediately." In December 2025, Trump declined to announce Powell reappointment — effectively signaling his intent to replace him when Powell's term expires in May 2026 — while continuing pressure campaigns designed to extract rate cuts before that date.

The culmination came in January 2026, when the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas threatening a criminal indictment against Powell, nominally related to his congressional testimony about a building renovation. Powell's response was direct: "The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President." Powell refused to comply with the subpoenas and refused to resign. The DOJ investigation represented what legal scholars and market analysts universally described as the weaponization of federal prosecution to coerce monetary policy — a constitutional crisis without precedent in American history.

**The Legal Vulnerability the Administration Exploited:**

The Federal Reserve Act specifies that the President may remove members of the Board of Governors "for cause." This language has historically been interpreted to require proof of misconduct — corruption, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. The Supreme Court's 1935 decision in *Humphrey's Executor v. United States*, 295 U.S. 602, upheld for-cause removal protections for multi-member independent commissions, holding that Congress may limit presidential removal power over agency heads who exercise quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions.

However, the Supreme Court's 2020 decision in *Seila Law LLC v. CFPB*, 591 U.S. 197, narrowed *Humphrey's Executor* significantly, holding that single-director independent agencies with broad executive authority cannot constitutionally limit presidential removal power. The Court distinguished multi-member commissions from single-director agencies. In December 2025, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in *Trump v. Slaughter* — a direct challenge to *Humphrey's Executor* arising from Trump's firing of FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya without cause. Legal scholars broadly anticipate that the Court's conservative supermajority will narrow or overturn *Humphrey's Executor*, potentially eliminating the statutory protection for all independent agency heads including the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. If the Court overturns or dramatically narrows *Humphrey's Executor*, no statutory language in the Federal Reserve Act would automatically protect Board members from removal — the for-cause language would be rendered unenforceable as applied.

This is not a hypothetical risk. It is the active legal trajectory of the Trump administration's assault on independent governance.

**The Market Consequences of Political Coercion:**

The Trump administration's pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve has already produced measurable financial market damage, and the full consequences of the DOJ investigation remain uncertain. When reporting of potential Powell firing circulated in mid-July 2025, the S&P 500 fell sharply and the U.S. dollar sank against major currencies. Bond markets, which price long-term interest rate expectations, reflected elevated uncertainty premium — meaning that long-term borrowing costs rose precisely because markets concluded that political interference with monetary policy was possible. This is the mechanism by which Fed independence protects ordinary Americans: when investors trust that the Fed will act on evidence rather than political command, they price lower risk premiums into long-term bonds, keeping mortgage rates, corporate borrowing costs, and government debt costs lower.

When that trust erodes — as it demonstrably did in 2025 and 2026 — the cost is borne not by the president, not by wealthy investors who can hedge against currency risk, but by ordinary Americans. The homebuyer who cannot afford a mortgage because rates are 50 basis points higher due to political risk premium. The small business owner who cannot access credit at reasonable terms. The retiree whose bond fund underperforms because the market is pricing Fed independence risk. The Trump administration's assault on Fed independence is, in economic terms, a tax on working Americans paid to protect the president's ability to demand cheap money on his political schedule.

### Damage Area 2: Abolishing the 2023 Community Reinvestment Act Rule

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. § 2901) was enacted to combat redlining — the systematic denial of banking services, credit, and mortgages to communities of color. CRA requires that federally insured banks affirmatively meet the credit needs of all communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. For nearly fifty years, CRA enforcement has been the primary federal tool to ensure that communities historically excluded from capital access can access mortgages, small business loans, and community development financing.

In October 2023, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC jointly issued a comprehensive modernization of CRA regulations — the most significant update since 1995 — expanding CRA coverage to include online and mobile banking activities, strengthening retail lending standards, requiring assessment of mortgage and small business lending in all census tracts served by a bank (not just where branches are located), and creating a new "Community Development" test requiring more robust investment in underserved communities.

In March 2025, the Trump administration's OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve Board announced their intent to rescind the 2023 CRA rule entirely. On July 16, 2025, the three agencies jointly issued a proposed rulemaking to replace the 2023 rule with the pre-modernization 1995 regulations — reverting to standards developed before internet banking existed, before mobile apps existed, and before community advocates had spent decades documenting their inadequacy. The administration's motivation was transparent: the 2023 rule had expanded accountability for digital-first and national banks that operated across the country while avoiding CRA obligations in communities where they had no physical branches.

The rollback of the 2023 CRA rule will redirect hundreds of billions of dollars in credit and investment away from low-income communities and communities of color. It will reduce CRA examination scrutiny for exactly the institutions — national online banks, large regional banks with extensive digital operations — that have displaced community development lenders while escaping accountability. It is a direct revival of the financial exclusion that CRA was enacted to prohibit.

**The Human Cost of CRA Rollback:**

The original CRA was enacted in response to documented evidence that banks systematically denied mortgages in Black and Latino neighborhoods — not because applicants were uncreditworthy, but because the neighborhoods were marked as high-risk based on race rather than individual credit characteristics. Redlining was not a metaphor. Federal agencies literally drew red lines on neighborhood maps around communities of color and marked them ineligible for federally backed mortgage lending. The consequence was a multi-generational wealth gap: white Americans who bought homes in the postwar era built equity, passed it to their children, and entered retirement with asset security. Black Americans denied those same mortgages built no equity, could not pass wealth to their children, and face a racial homeownership gap that persists today at approximately 30 percentage points — the same gap that existed in 1968 when the Fair Housing Act was enacted.

CRA enforcement is one of the primary mechanisms available to close that gap. When banks must demonstrate affirmative lending in underserved communities as a condition of regulatory approval for mergers and acquisitions, they create lending programs that would not otherwise exist. Community development financial institutions — CDFIs — depend on CRA-motivated investment from large banks to fund small business lending, affordable housing construction, and consumer credit in low-income communities. The Trump administration's CRA rollback will dry up this pipeline, reducing affordable housing construction and small business lending in exactly the communities that most depend on it.

### Damage Area 3: Abandoning Climate Risk Supervision

**What Project 2025 Did:**

In 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve conducted a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise with six of the nation's largest banks — Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo — examining how their loan and investment portfolios would respond to both physical climate risks (flooding, wildfire, hurricane damage to real estate collateral) and transition risks (policy shifts accelerating the decline of fossil fuel industries). These exercises were explicitly supervisory in purpose: the Fed, as systemic risk regulator, has statutory responsibility to ensure that financial institutions identify and manage risks to their safety and soundness.

In October 2025, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC withdrew from the principles governing climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions — principles developed jointly in 2023. The withdrawal gutted supervisory expectations for climate risk identification, scenario analysis, and board-level oversight at large banks. This decision was driven by political pressure from the Trump administration, which had systematically dismantled climate risk analysis across all federal agencies, and by the banking industry, which had lobbied aggressively against climate risk supervisory obligations.

The consequences are systemic. U.S. commercial banks hold trillions of dollars in real estate loans collateralized by properties in coastal flood zones, wildfire corridors, and climate-vulnerable regions. Insurance markets are withdrawing from these areas — a leading indicator of collateral value deterioration that threatens bank balance sheets. Eliminating supervisory requirements for climate risk analysis does not eliminate the underlying risk. It eliminates the early warning system.

### Damage Area 4: Banning the Digital Dollar and Ceding Digital Finance to Private Stablecoins

**What Project 2025 Did:**

On January 23, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order titled "Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology," which prohibited all federal agencies from undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote a central bank digital currency. The order simultaneously directed development of a regulatory framework for private, dollar-denominated stablecoins — effectively channeling the future of U.S. digital currency infrastructure to private companies operating outside the Federal Reserve's monetary control.

In July 2025, the House of Representatives passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act (H.R. 1919), prohibiting the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital currency directly to the public. Shortly thereafter, Trump signed the GENIUS Act establishing a regulatory framework for private stablecoins.

The policy choice here is not neutral. A central bank digital currency issued by the Federal Reserve would give every American — including the approximately 6 million households with no bank account and the approximately 19 million with severely limited banking access — direct access to a safe, government-backed digital payment instrument. Instead, the Trump administration is directing digital payment innovation to private stablecoins issued by companies that are not banks, do not hold FDIC deposit insurance, and are not subject to the same consumer protection and systemic risk standards as depository institutions. Stablecoin issuers will profit from holding U.S. Treasury securities as reserves — reserves that generate income for private shareholders — while providing payment services that could otherwise be offered at cost by the Federal Reserve.

The administration's stated concern — that a CBDC would enable government surveillance of individual transactions — is the opposite of the actual policy consequence: private stablecoin companies will have access to the full transaction histories of their users, with far weaker privacy obligations than a government-run system subject to constitutional constraints.

**Who Pays for the Absence of a Digital Dollar:**

Approximately 6 million American households are unbanked — meaning they have no checking or savings account at a bank or credit union. An additional 19 million households are underbanked, meaning they have a bank account but rely on expensive alternative financial services for core financial functions. Unbanked and underbanked Americans disproportionately are Black, Latino, low-income, and rural. Without a bank account, receiving wages requires using a check casher that charges 1–3 percent of the check face value. Paying bills requires purchasing money orders at fees of $1–$5 per transaction. Building credit history is impossible. Accumulating savings in an interest-bearing account is impossible. The American Bankers Association has estimated that unbanked and underbanked households pay approximately $2,400 per year in fees and interest for services that banked households receive free or at low cost. A Federal Reserve digital dollar — a government-issued digital account accessible by mobile phone — would eliminate these costs at a stroke, extending full financial participation to Americans whom the private banking system has concluded are not profitable enough to serve.

### Damage Area 5: Weakening Systemic Risk Supervision and Dodd-Frank Rollback

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025's financial regulatory chapter proposes eliminating or dramatically weakening the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), repealing the Orderly Liquidation Authority established by Dodd-Frank (which provides the legal mechanism to wind down failing systemically important financial institutions without taxpayer bailouts), and rolling back enhanced prudential standards for large banks.

The Trump administration's first term had already raised the asset threshold for enhanced supervision from $50 billion to $250 billion — exempting dozens of large regional banks from heightened stress testing, liquidity requirements, and resolution planning. The 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank — three of the largest bank failures in American history — occurred directly because those institutions had been exempted from enhanced supervision by the 2018 rollback. The second Trump administration has continued this trajectory, with Trump's nominees to bank supervisory positions favoring deregulation of capital and liquidity standards.

Project 2025 also proposes eliminating the Fed's role in supervising nonbank financial companies designated as systemically important — effectively removing the regulator of last resort from the largest corners of the shadow banking system, including large asset managers, hedge funds, and insurance companies whose distress poses systemic risk.

### Damage Area 6: The Gold Standard Proposal and the Destruction of Monetary Policy Capacity

**What Project 2025 Proposed:**

Project 2025's monetary policy chapter explicitly raises the option of returning the United States to a gold standard — a monetary system in which the value of the dollar is fixed to a specific quantity of gold, and the money supply is constrained by gold reserves rather than by economic conditions. The gold standard was abandoned by the United States in stages: domestic gold convertibility was ended by President Roosevelt in 1933 during the Depression, and the Bretton Woods system of international gold convertibility was ended by President Nixon in 1971.

The gold standard is not a conservative policy proposal in any defensible economic sense. It is a proposal to eliminate the government's ability to use monetary policy as a stabilization tool. Under a gold standard, when a recession hits and unemployment rises, the Federal Reserve cannot lower interest rates or expand the money supply to stimulate economic activity — unless gold reserves happen to expand at the same rate, which is determined by mining output, not by economic need. The historical record is clear: the gold standard deepened and prolonged the Great Depression by preventing monetary expansion at exactly the moment when expansion was needed most. Every major economy abandoned the gold standard precisely because it made monetary policy procyclical — contracting the money supply in recessions and expanding it in booms — the opposite of what stabilization policy requires.

The Project 2025 proposal to explore returning to the gold standard is not a serious monetary policy proposal. It is an ideological statement that the government should not have the tools to fight recessions. If implemented, it would transfer the costs of economic downturns entirely from financial institutions — which would still be protected by private contract enforcement — to workers, who would face unemployment without any monetary policy backstop.

---

### The Stakes for Independence

The Federal Reserve's institutional independence was not created to insulate technocrats from accountability. It was created because monetary policy decisions — when to raise rates to combat inflation, when to cut rates to prevent unemployment from rising, when to inject emergency liquidity to prevent bank runs from cascading into economic collapse — require time horizons longer than the next election cycle. Inflation takes twelve to eighteen months to respond to interest rate changes. A president who can pressure the Fed chair into cutting rates before an election will create inflationary pressure that materializes after the election, imposing costs on workers, families, and small businesses who cannot hedge against purchasing power loss.

Every major economy with a record of monetary stability — the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan — operates its central bank with a formal independence structure. When central bank independence erodes, the historical record is unambiguous: inflation expectations become unanchored, long-term interest rates rise, investment planning horizons shorten, and the economy's capacity to sustain full employment without inflation deteriorates. Turkey's experience after President Erdogan began dictating interest rate policy provides the recent cautionary example: the lira collapsed, inflation exceeded 80 percent, and ordinary Turkish citizens saw their savings destroyed in real terms.

The Trump administration's campaign against the Federal Reserve — public harassment, firing threats, prosecutorial intimidation, replacement of supervisory leadership with political loyalists — is not a dispute about the right level of interest rates. It is an attempt to subordinate monetary policy to presidential electoral interests, with the full economic costs borne by working Americans.

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

The Constitution grants Congress authority over money in two provisions: Article I, Section 8, Clause 5 (the Coinage Clause), granting Congress power to "coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin"; and Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 (the Necessary and Proper Clause), granting Congress broad authority to enact legislation necessary to execute its enumerated powers. Congress exercised these authorities when it enacted the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, creating the Federal Reserve System as the nation's central bank.

The Federal Reserve's independence rests on Congress's constitutional authority to structure executive branch agencies as it sees fit, subject to the President's Article II appointment and removal powers. *Humphrey's Executor v. United States*, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), held that Congress may constitutionally limit presidential removal of commissioners of multi-member independent agencies to "for cause," protecting quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions from direct presidential control. This precedent is now under direct assault at the Supreme Court in *Trump v. Slaughter*.

If the Supreme Court overturns *Humphrey's Executor*, Congress retains constitutional authority to respond through statute. Congress can establish the Federal Reserve as a legislative agency rather than an executive agency, fund it through means other than the appropriations process (the Fed already funds itself through earnings on its asset portfolio), and create statutory procedures requiring Senate confirmation for removal — creating political accountability for any president who attempts to remove a Fed Governor without cause. The constitutional tools to protect Fed independence remain available; what is required is the political will to use them.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 221 et seq.**: The foundational statute establishing the Federal Reserve System, the Board of Governors, the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee. Section 10 of the Act provides that Governors may be removed "for cause." The Act provides the Fed's authority to conduct open market operations, set reserve requirements, and supervise member banks.

**Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (Humphrey-Hawkins Act), 15 U.S.C. § 3101 et seq.**: Codified the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. Requires the Fed to report to Congress on its monetary policy plans and to explain how those plans serve the dual mandate. This statute is the legal foundation for requiring FOMC deliberations to address unemployment, including racial and geographic disparities in unemployment.

**Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 12 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq.**: Enacted following the 2008 financial crisis, Dodd-Frank dramatically expanded Federal Reserve supervisory authority over bank holding companies, established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), created the Orderly Liquidation Authority, required stress testing of large banks, mandated enhanced prudential standards for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within the Federal Reserve System.

**Community Reinvestment Act, 12 U.S.C. § 2901 et seq.**: Requires federally insured depository institutions to meet the credit needs of all communities in which they operate, with CRA examination results factored into decisions on bank mergers, acquisitions, and branch applications.

**Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1841 et seq.**: Grants the Federal Reserve authority to supervise and regulate bank holding companies and financial holding companies, review and approve or deny acquisitions and mergers, and impose requirements on permissible activities.

**Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 12 U.S.C. § 2801 et seq.**: Requires lenders to collect and report data on mortgage applications, originations, and denials by race, ethnicity, sex, income, and geography — providing the evidentiary foundation for fair lending enforcement and CRA examination.

### Removal Protection and the Independent Agency Framework

The specific removal provision at issue is Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act, which specifies that Board of Governors members shall be appointed for fourteen-year terms and "may be removed for cause by the President." The phrase "for cause" has never been judicially tested in the specific context of the Federal Reserve. Given *Seila Law*'s distinction between single-director agencies (no for-cause protection permissible) and multi-member commissions (protection permissible under *Humphrey's Executor*), the Federal Reserve Board — a seven-member body — should fall clearly within the multi-member commission category that *Humphrey's Executor* protects.

However, if the Supreme Court overturns *Humphrey's Executor* entirely in *Trump v. Slaughter*, the for-cause limitation in the Federal Reserve Act would be rendered unenforceable. Congress must respond legislatively before this judicial outcome materializes.

The critical distinction between the Federal Reserve and other independent agencies targeted in the administration's removal campaign is the nature of the harm from political control. When a president removes an FTC commissioner without cause, the immediate harm is to antitrust enforcement. When a president removes a Federal Reserve Board member without cause — or credibly threatens to do so — the harm is global in scope and immediate in market impact: inflation expectations can become unanchored overnight, long-term interest rates can spike within trading sessions, and the dollar's reserve currency status can be damaged in ways that take years to repair. The Federal Reserve presents the strongest possible case for statutory independence protection precisely because the costs of political interference are so severe, so rapid, and so widely distributed across the entire population.

### The Federal Reserve's Supervisory Structure and Its Vulnerabilities

The Federal Reserve's supervisory authorities extend across three distinct domains, each of which has been targeted by the Trump administration:

**Bank holding company supervision** (12 U.S.C. § 1844): The Fed supervises all bank holding companies — corporate entities that own one or more banks — which collectively account for the vast majority of U.S. banking assets. This supervisory authority includes the power to approve or deny mergers and acquisitions, impose capital and liquidity requirements, conduct examinations, and take enforcement actions. The Trump administration has systematically weakened capital standards and reduced examination intensity, reversing the post-2008 supervisory framework built to prevent a recurrence of systemic collapse.

**Payment system oversight** (12 U.S.C. § 5461 et seq.): The Federal Reserve designates and oversees systemically important financial market utilities — the infrastructure through which trillions of dollars in financial transactions settle daily. Any disruption to payment system infrastructure would freeze financial markets. The Trump administration's deregulatory posture has reduced supervisory intensity over these utilities.

**Consumer protection and fair lending** (12 U.S.C. § 2801 et seq., § 2901 et seq.): The Federal Reserve's Division of Consumer and Community Affairs oversees fair lending compliance and CRA performance for state member banks and bank holding companies. The Trump administration's rescission of the 2023 CRA rule, combined with its gutting of the CFPB, has effectively dismantled federal fair lending enforcement infrastructure.

---

## Part III: Comprehensive Federal Reserve Reform

The reforms outlined in this chapter proceed from a single organizing principle: the Federal Reserve must serve the whole American economy, not a politically preferred constituency. This means monetary policy independent of electoral pressure. It means bank supervision that protects depositors and the financial system from excessive risk, not regulatory capture that allows financial institutions to externalize that risk onto the public. It means fair lending enforcement that closes the racial wealth gap rather than permitting its continuation. It means payment system modernization that brings every American into the financial system rather than ceding digital finance to private companies that profit from exclusion. And it means governance structures that reflect the public interest rather than the preferences of the banking industry that the Federal Reserve supervises.

The reforms are sequenced by urgency and legal authority. Day One executive actions address the most immediate harms — the CBDC ban, the ongoing DOJ assault on Fed independence — that require no legislation. Regulatory actions through the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, and FDIC reinstate supervisory standards within weeks and months. Legislative proposals transform the structural framework over years. The complete program, if enacted, will make the Federal Reserve both more independent of political pressure and more accountable to the full range of its public obligations — a combination that Project 2025's architects, who want political control of monetary policy while eliminating accountability for distributional consequences, find contradictory only because they have confused "independence from politics" with "unaccountable to the public." These are different things. The Federal Reserve must be independent from electoral politics while remaining accountable, through its statutory mandates, to the economic welfare of all Americans.

### Reform I: Statutory Codification of Federal Reserve Independence

The single most important reform this administration must execute is legislative: passage of the Federal Reserve Independence Preservation Act, which codifies removal standards with greater specificity, creates procedural requirements for any removal proceeding, and establishes congressional remedies for violations.

**Specific Actions:**

Issue an executive order on Day One directing all executive branch agencies, including the Department of Justice, to cease any investigation, subpoena, prosecution, or legal proceeding targeting Federal Reserve officials for actions taken in their official monetary policy capacity. Direct the Attorney General to issue a formal opinion clarifying that the for-cause limitation in the Federal Reserve Act is valid and enforceable.

Introduce and advocate for passage of the Federal Reserve Independence Preservation Act within the first sixty days of taking office. This legislation must:

Define "cause" for removal of Federal Reserve Board members with specificity: removal is permissible only upon a formal finding of corruption, bribery, gross neglect of statutory duties, or criminal conviction. Policy disagreement, interest rate decisions, and exercise of monetary policy judgment do not constitute cause.

Establish a judicial review procedure: any president seeking to remove a Board member must file a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit specifying the grounds for removal; removal is stayed pending judicial review; and the burden of proof rests on the removing party.

Create congressional standing to seek injunctive relief against removal proceedings that do not comply with statutory standards, allowing Congress to enforce the independence statute without waiting for the affected official to sue.

Prohibit executive branch agencies from investigating, subpoenaing, or prosecuting Federal Reserve officials for monetary policy decisions, FOMC deliberations, or official testimony before Congress regarding monetary policy, absent evidence of personal financial fraud wholly unrelated to official duties.

**Legal Authority**: Congress's constitutional authority to structure executive agencies under Article I, § 8, cl. 18; *Humphrey's Executor v. United States*, 295 U.S. 602 (1935); the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 221 et seq.).

---

### Reform II: Strengthening and Expanding the Dual Mandate

The Humphrey-Hawkins Act (15 U.S.C. § 3101) established the dual mandate but has never been updated to reflect economic research demonstrating that the employment leg of the mandate has systematically underperformed, particularly for Black Americans, Latino Americans, and workers in rural and post-industrial communities. The national unemployment rate can mask severe racial and geographic disparities: when the national unemployment rate is 4 percent, the Black unemployment rate is typically 7–8 percent, and unemployment in distressed rural communities may exceed 10 percent.

**Specific Actions:**

Direct the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, through executive communication (not dictation), to prioritize the employment mandate in FOMC communications and to explicitly report on racial and geographic unemployment differentials in Monetary Policy Reports to Congress. This is not political interference — it is directional communication that falls within the President's legitimate authority to communicate policy priorities to independent agencies through public channels, not coercion.

Introduce the Maximum Employment Equity Act, requiring the Federal Reserve to:

Report to Congress, in each semi-annual Monetary Policy Report, disaggregated unemployment data by race, ethnicity, gender, geographic region, and educational attainment.

Establish an internal "employment equity gap" metric tracking the differential between white unemployment and Black unemployment, and between metropolitan and non-metropolitan unemployment, as a standing FOMC agenda item.

Publish the "employment equity gap" data monthly alongside standard unemployment statistics on the Federal Reserve website.

Require FOMC minutes to document the specific employment equity data considered in interest rate deliberations.

Create a Federal Reserve Racial Economic Equity Office within the Board of Governors, with a director appointed by the Chair subject to Senate confirmation, to develop research on the distributional effects of monetary policy decisions and provide formal input to FOMC deliberations.

**Legal Authority**: Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act (15 U.S.C. § 3101); Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 225a, the statutory dual mandate); Congress's authority to expand reporting requirements on the Federal Reserve under Article I.

### Reform III: Restoring and Strengthening the Community Reinvestment Act

The Trump administration's rescission of the 2023 CRA rule represents the most consequential rollback of anti-redlining law in a generation. Restoration is not enough — the next administration must advance CRA modernization further than the 2023 rule reached.

**Specific Actions:**

Direct the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, OCC, and FDIC, on Day One, to withdraw the proposed rescission of the 2023 CRA rule and reinstate the 2023 rule immediately as the operative regulatory framework, pending a comprehensive review to be completed within 180 days.

Within 180 days, finalize a new CRA rule that goes beyond the 2023 version to:

Extend CRA obligations to all federally chartered or insured financial institutions, including nonbank mortgage lenders and fintechs that accept insured deposits or participate in federal credit programs. The 1977 CRA was written for a world of branch-based banking; the statute's coverage must reflect twenty-first-century financial intermediation.

Require CRA performance ratings to be calculated separately for mortgage lending, small business lending, consumer lending, and community development investment — eliminating the ability of institutions to cross-subsidize poor lending performance with large community development grants.

Establish a presumptive denial standard for bank merger and acquisition applications from institutions with "Needs to Improve" or "Substantial Noncompliance" CRA ratings.

Require public comment periods of not less than 90 days — rather than the current 30 days — for merger applications by large banks, during which CRA performance must be specifically assessed.

Expand HMDA data reporting requirements to include loan pricing data, denial reasons, and credit score distributions by race, enabling more precise discrimination detection.

Direct the Federal Reserve's Division of Consumer and Community Affairs to triple the number of CRA examinations of large banks (assets exceeding $10 billion) and publish examination results in searchable, machine-readable format.

**Legal Authority**: Community Reinvestment Act (12 U.S.C. § 2901 et seq.); Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (12 U.S.C. § 2801 et seq.); Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. § 1691 et seq.); Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604 et seq.).

### Reform IV: Mandatory Climate Risk Integration in Bank Supervision

The Federal Reserve is the systemic risk regulator for the U.S. banking system. Climate change presents systemic financial risk through physical asset deterioration, transition risk to fossil fuel industry borrowers, and contagion through insurance market withdrawal. The Fed's withdrawal from climate risk supervisory principles in October 2025 abandoned the core function of systemic risk oversight.

**Specific Actions:**

Direct the Federal Reserve Board, through the Vice Chair for Supervision, to reinstate climate-related financial risk management principles for all large financial institutions (assets exceeding $100 billion) within sixty days of taking office.

Introduce the Climate Financial Risk Supervision Act requiring:

The Federal Reserve to conduct annual climate scenario analysis for all bank holding companies with assets exceeding $50 billion, publishing results in aggregate and by institution.

Integration of physical climate risk and transition risk into the annual stress testing cycle for large banks. Stress scenarios must include, at minimum: a severe acute physical risk scenario (major hurricane season, flood event, or wildfire season); a disorderly transition scenario (rapid carbon pricing); and a long-run physical risk scenario reflecting thirty-year asset exposure.

Fed-supervised institutions to disclose climate-related financial risks in standardized, machine-readable format aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.

Prohibition on the Federal Reserve approving any merger or acquisition application from a large bank unless the applicant has demonstrated adequate climate risk identification and management processes.

Expanded Fed supervisory authority over insurance holding companies that are affiliated with bank holding companies — closing the supervisory gap created when insurance subsidiaries withdraw from high-climate-risk markets while affiliated banks continue lending into those markets.

**Legal Authority**: Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 263, § 248, § 321); Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. § 5365, enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies); Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1, safety and soundness standards).

The link between climate risk and financial stability is not speculative — it is established in the supervisory record. Following Hurricane Harvey in 2017, residential mortgage default rates in the Houston metropolitan area rose sharply in flood-affected neighborhoods, with particularly concentrated defaults on FHA-insured and privately securitized loans collateralized by properties outside federal flood zone boundaries that had not been required to carry flood insurance. The supervisory lesson is direct: climate risk concentrates in bank loan portfolios in ways that are not fully captured by existing credit models calibrated to historical weather patterns. As climate change drives flood, wildfire, and hurricane risk beyond historical parameters, banks' loan losses will exceed model predictions — unless supervisors require banks to model forward-looking climate risk explicitly. The Fed's withdrawal from climate risk supervisory principles in October 2025 abandoned this supervisory imperative.

### Reform V: Federal Reserve Digital Payments and a Public Digital Dollar Framework

The Trump administration's ban on CBDC development and its pivot to private stablecoins represents a fundamental policy choice to privatize the future of U.S. monetary infrastructure. This administration must reverse that choice.

**Specific Actions:**

Issue an executive order on Day One rescinding the January 23, 2025 executive order banning CBDC development. Direct the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and Office of Science and Technology Policy to develop a Federal Digital Dollar Framework within 180 days.

Introduce the Federal Reserve Digital Payments Act authorizing:

A Federal Reserve Digital Dollar pilot program serving unbanked and underbanked Americans, offering no-fee digital accounts accessible through mobile devices, postal service locations, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), and library systems.

Research and development of a wholesale CBDC for interbank settlement — a more limited and less politically contested form of digital currency that could dramatically increase the efficiency and resilience of the payment system without requiring mass retail distribution.

Mandatory expansion of FedNow instant payment infrastructure to all federally insured depository institutions, credit unions, and community banks by January 2027. FedNow launched in 2023 but uptake among smaller institutions has been limited due to implementation costs — the legislation must provide transition funding for institutions with assets under $1 billion.

A Federal Reserve Digital Payments Equity Fund, capitalized at $500 million annually, to subsidize payment account access for underbanked communities, including translation services, financial literacy programming, and low-income fee waivers.

Privacy standards for any Federal Reserve digital payment system must equal or exceed the privacy protections applicable to physical Federal Reserve notes — ensuring that the government's access to transaction data requires a warrant, not administrative subpoena.

**Legal Authority**: Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 221 et seq., § 246, authority over payment systems); Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. § 5302, payment, clearing, and settlement supervision); Expedited Funds Availability Act (12 U.S.C. § 4001 et seq.); U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 5 (Coinage Clause) and cl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause).

### Reform VI: Regional Federal Reserve Bank Governance Reform

The twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks are not government agencies — they are quasi-private institutions owned by their member banks. Each regional bank has a nine-member board of directors divided into three classes: Class A directors elected by member banks (representing banking interests); Class B directors elected by member banks but required to represent the public; and Class C directors appointed by the Board of Governors. The presidents of the regional Federal Reserve Banks — who sit on the FOMC and vote on interest rate decisions — are appointed by their boards subject to approval by the Board of Governors.

This structure concentrates private banking industry influence at the center of monetary policy. Class A directors are bank executives elected by the banks the Federal Reserve supervises. Regional bank presidents are selected through a process in which banking industry representatives participate in the search committee and vote on the appointment. This is a structural conflict of interest: the regulated choosing their regulator.

**Specific Actions:**

Introduce the Federal Reserve Governance Modernization Act requiring:

Elimination of Class A director positions on all twelve regional Federal Reserve Bank boards. All nine board positions at each regional bank to be publicly appointed — six by the Board of Governors and three by the relevant state legislatures within the district.

Board composition requirements mandating geographic, racial, gender, and occupational diversity: each board must include representatives from labor, agriculture, small business, consumer advocacy, and community development, in addition to finance.

Regional Federal Reserve Bank president appointments to be subject to Senate confirmation, bringing democratic accountability to monetary policy participants who currently face no public confirmation process.

An annual public conflict-of-interest disclosure requirement for all regional Federal Reserve Bank board members and senior officers.

A prohibition on regional bank board members participating in any vote or deliberation regarding institutions in which they hold a financial interest, with enforced recusal tracked by the Board of Governors.

**Legal Authority**: Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 302–308, regional bank board composition); Congress's plenary authority over Federal Reserve structure under Article I, § 8; *Lewis v. United States*, 680 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1982) (affirming quasi-public nature of regional Federal Reserve Banks).

The governance reform serves a purpose beyond symbolic equity. Regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents vote on FOMC interest rate decisions. Of the twelve regional bank presidents, eleven are rotational FOMC voters in any given year (the New York Fed president votes permanently). When those presidents are selected by boards dominated by banking industry executives — the regulated influencing the regulator's choice of leadership — the FOMC is systematically tilted toward the preferences of the financial sector. Academic research has documented that Federal Reserve officials with banking industry backgrounds demonstrate statistically measurable differences in monetary policy preference, favoring higher interest rates (which benefit creditors) over lower rates (which reduce unemployment but compress interest margins). Democratic governance of regional Federal Reserve Bank boards is not a procedural reform. It is a correction of structural capture that has distorted monetary policy in favor of financial sector interests for over a century.

### Reform VII: Restoring and Expanding Dodd-Frank Systemic Risk Supervision

The 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank's enhanced prudential standards directly caused the 2023 failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. The Trump administration's second term has continued deregulation of large bank capital and liquidity requirements. This administration must restore and expand the systemic risk supervisory architecture that protects the financial system from its own instability.

**Specific Actions:**

Issue an executive order directing the Federal Reserve to reinstate enhanced prudential standards for all bank holding companies with assets exceeding $100 billion, restoring the $50 billion threshold eliminated in 2018.

Direct the Vice Chair for Supervision to reinstate the stress capital buffer framework and require annual stress tests for all bank holding companies with assets exceeding $50 billion.

Introduce the Systemic Risk Accountability Act restoring:

Full FSOC authority to designate nonbank financial companies as systemically important, subject to Federal Reserve enhanced supervision. The Trump administration effectively eliminated nonbank SIFI designation — leaving large asset managers, insurance companies, and hedge funds outside the systemic risk supervisory framework.

Orderly Liquidation Authority implementation protocols, requiring systemically important institutions to submit credible living wills annually, with Federal Reserve authority to impose remediation requirements on institutions whose resolution plans are deemed inadequate.

Prohibitions on the Federal Reserve approving large bank mergers that would increase systemic concentration without conducting a public interest analysis of competitive, systemic risk, and community impacts.

Capital surcharge requirements for globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs), calibrated to their systemic footprint, with authority to increase surcharges during periods of elevated systemic risk.

Interagency coordination requirements between the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, CFPB, and SEC for supervisory information sharing on institutions operating across regulatory perimeters.

**Legal Authority**: Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. § 5365, § 5382, § 5390); Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1); Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. § 1843); Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 248).

The 2023 bank failures are not a historical anecdote. They are a direct demonstration of what happens when political pressure produces regulatory rollback. Silicon Valley Bank held $209 billion in assets at the time of its failure — the second-largest bank failure in American history. Its failure was directly attributable to the 2018 rollback of enhanced prudential standards: under the pre-rollback framework, SVB would have been subject to regular stress testing and liquidity requirements that would have flagged its catastrophic interest rate risk exposure years before its collapse. Instead, SVB was exempted from enhanced supervision by the statutory threshold change. The Federal Reserve's own internal review, published in April 2023, acknowledged that supervisory failures contributed to the bank's collapse. Those supervisory failures did not occur in a vacuum — they occurred because the regulatory environment created by the 2018 rollback discouraged supervisors from imposing requirements that would have been redundant if enhanced prudential standards still applied. The next administration must restore these standards and ensure that the supervisory culture that allowed SVB-level risk to accumulate without correction is rebuilt from the ground up.

---

### Reform VIII: Protecting the Lender of Last Resort Function

The Federal Reserve's authority to provide emergency lending to prevent financial system collapse is codified in Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 343), which authorizes the Fed to lend to any individual, partnership, or corporation in "unusual and exigent circumstances." This authority was invoked in 2008 to stabilize the financial system and in 2020 to prevent the COVID-19 recession from becoming a financial crisis.

Project 2025 proposes eliminating the lender-of-last-resort function on the grounds that it creates moral hazard. This is a policy position that would guarantee that any significant financial institution failure would cascade into a systemic crisis — precisely because counterparties and depositors would know that no emergency backstop exists, causing them to run first rather than wait to assess whether the institution is solvent.

**Specific Actions:**

Protect Section 13(3) emergency lending authority in statute, specifically prohibiting any executive order from limiting the Fed's emergency lending authority without congressional authorization.

Require the Federal Reserve to report to Congress within 72 hours of invoking Section 13(3) authority, providing the terms of any emergency lending facility, the institutions eligible, and the conditions attached.

Establish a permanent Section 13(3) Oversight Panel within Congress — with members appointed by majority and minority leadership of both chambers — to review emergency lending programs and report publicly on their terms, costs, and resolution.

Require the Federal Reserve to publish the collateral, interest rates, and repayment terms of all emergency lending facilities within sixty days of their termination, with a permanent public record.

**Legal Authority**: Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. § 343, lender of last resort); Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. § 5601, limitations on Section 13(3) authority added in 2010).

Initiate rulemaking to require all bank holding companies with assets exceeding $10 billion to publish annual reports on their lending activity disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and geography — going beyond HMDA data to include pricing, credit score, and loan-to-value information that enables regulators and the public to assess fair lending compliance.

Seek legislation to fund the Federal Reserve's supervisory activities through a dedicated assessment on large bank holding companies rather than through the existing earnings-based self-funding mechanism, ensuring that supervisory intensity is not constrained by the Fed's income volatility during economic downturns.

## Cross-References

The Federal Reserve's supervisory and monetary policy functions intersect with other areas of Project 2029's comprehensive reform program:

- **Chapter 22 (Treasury)**: Treasury and the Federal Reserve coordinate on debt management, fiscal-monetary policy interaction, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Treasury's leadership of FSOC is addressed in Chapter 22.
- **Chapter 27 (Financial Regulatory Agencies)**: The Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regulate financial markets and consumers in domains that intersect with Federal Reserve bank supervision. Coordination between the Fed, SEC, and CFPB on systemic risk and consumer protection is addressed in Chapter 27.
- **Chapter 28 (Legal Accountability)**: The DOJ criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and the broader pattern of executive branch weaponization of federal prosecution against independent agency officials, is addressed in the Legal Accountability framework of Chapter 28.
- **Chapter 13 (EPA)**: Climate risk supervision of bank portfolios intersects with EPA climate regulation — the transition risk that banks face in their fossil fuel industry loan portfolios is directly affected by the pace of environmental regulatory transition addressed in Chapter 13.
- **Chapter 15 (HUD)**: Federal Reserve CRA enforcement and fair lending supervision directly affect housing access and the racial homeownership gap addressed in Chapter 15's housing finance reform program.
