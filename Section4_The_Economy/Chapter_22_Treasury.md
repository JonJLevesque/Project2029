# Chapter 22: Department of the Treasury
## Tax Fairness and Wealth Inequality Transformation

## Executive Summary

The Treasury Department is the engine of fiscal justice. Project 2025 extended and expanded Trump-era tax cuts for billionaires and corporations while gutting IRS enforcement capacity—ensuring the wealthy could evade what little they owed while working families paid their fair share. The result: billionaires pay lower effective tax rates than nurses, teachers, and firefighters.

This chapter outlines a fundamental transformation of American taxation: closing the loopholes that allow billionaires to escape taxation entirely, imposing meaningful wealth taxes on extreme fortunes, ensuring corporations pay their fair share, and building the IRS enforcement capacity to collect taxes owed. Combined with carbon pricing, this agenda generates **$650-700 billion annually** to fund universal healthcare, housing, education, and climate action.

**The Stakes**: Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. Elon Musk paid $0 in federal income tax in 2018. Jeff Bezos paid $0 in 2007 and 2011. The 25 richest Americans paid an average 3.4% effective tax rate from 2014-2018. Meanwhile, working families pay 25%+. This isn't a bug—it's a feature of a tax code written by and for the wealthy. We end it now.

**Key Reforms**:
- **Billionaire Minimum Tax (30-35%)**: End the "buy, borrow, die" strategy—tax unrealized gains and imputed income on billionaire wealth
- **Capital Gains Equality**: Tax investment income the same as work—no more preferential rates for the wealthy
- **Wealth Tax**: 2% annual tax on fortunes over $50 million, 3% over $1 billion
- **Corporate Tax Reform**: Restore 28% rate, close loopholes, enforce global minimum tax
- **Carried Interest Closure**: End the hedge fund loophole that lets managers pay lower rates than their employees
- **Offshore Tax Haven Crackdown**: Aggressive FATCA enforcement, beneficial ownership transparency, enabler prosecution
- **Estate Tax Strengthening**: Eliminate stepped-up basis, lower exemptions, close dynasty trust loopholes
- **IRS Enforcement Surge**: 50,000+ new agents, targeted audits of millionaires and billionaires
- **Carbon Tax**: $50/ton with annual increases, carbon dividend to households
- **Church Taxation Reform**: 67% charitable distribution requirement or lose tax exemption

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: 16th Amendment (income tax authority "from whatever source derived"), Article I Section 8 (taxation power), Internal Revenue Code, Bank Secrecy Act, Corporate Transparency Act, *Moore v. United States* (2024) upholding congressional authority to define income.

**Revenue Impact**: $650-700 billion annually in new federal revenue.

## Part I: Project 2025 Tax Damage Assessment

### The Assault on Tax Fairness

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Project 2025 systematically tilted the tax code further toward the wealthy:

**Extended and Expanded Trump Tax Cuts:**
- Made 2017 TCJA provisions permanent for corporations (21% rate locked in)
- Extended individual rate cuts benefiting highest brackets
- Preserved pass-through deduction (Section 199A) primarily benefiting wealthy business owners
- Protected estate tax exemption ($13.6 million per person) for dynastic wealth transfer
- Preserved stepped-up basis (complete forgiveness of unrealized gains at death)

**Gutted IRS Enforcement:**
- Cancelled 87,000 IRS agent hiring authorized by Inflation Reduction Act
- Redirected IRS funding away from high-income enforcement
- Reduced audit rates for millionaires from already-low 1% to near-zero
- Closed IRS field offices
- Eliminated specialized wealth squad programs

**Expanded Loopholes:**
- Protected carried interest (hedge fund manager loophole)
- Expanded opportunity zones (benefiting wealthy investors in gentrification)
- Created new pass-through vehicles for tax avoidance
- Weakened FATCA enforcement against offshore tax evasion
- Delayed beneficial ownership transparency rules

### The Wealth Inequality Crisis

**The Numbers Don't Lie:**

**Effective Tax Rates (ProPublica "Secret IRS Files" revelations):**
| Taxpayer | True Tax Rate |
|----------|---------------|
| Warren Buffett | 0.1% |
| Jeff Bezos | 0.98% |
| Michael Bloomberg | 1.3% |
| Elon Musk | 3.27% |
| **Average American** | **25%+** |

**Wealth Concentration:**
- Top 0.1% own as much as bottom 90% combined
- Top 1% own more than the entire middle class
- Three Americans (Bezos, Musk, Buffett) own more than bottom 50% (165 million people)
- Billionaire wealth doubled during pandemic while millions lost jobs
- 735 billionaires hold $5+ trillion in wealth

**The Tax Gap:**
- $600+ billion annually in taxes owed but not paid
- 70%+ of tax gap comes from wealthy individuals and corporations
- IRS audits fewer than 1% of millionaires
- Wealthy have sophisticated avoidance strategies unavailable to workers
- Working families have taxes automatically withheld; wealthy defer indefinitely

### How Billionaires Pay Zero Taxes: "Buy, Borrow, Die"

**The Strategy:**

1. **BUY**: Acquire appreciating assets (stocks, real estate, businesses)
   - Appreciation is not taxed until "realized" (sold)
   - Billionaires never sell—they hold indefinitely

2. **BORROW**: Take loans against assets
   - Loan proceeds are NOT taxable income
   - Interest rates for billionaires: 1-3%
   - Use loans for living expenses, investments, political donations
   - Never sell, never realize gains, never pay taxes

3. **DIE**: Pass assets to heirs with "stepped-up basis"
   - All unrealized appreciation ERASED at death
   - Heirs receive assets at current market value
   - Lifetime of gains completely untaxed—forever
   - Repeat cycle with next generation

**Example: $1 Billion in 1990, $100 Billion in 2024**
- Original investment: $1 billion
- Current value: $100 billion
- Unrealized gain: $99 billion
- Taxes paid on gain: $0
- Borrowing against assets: $50+ billion for spending
- Taxes paid on borrowed money: $0
- At death: Heirs receive at $100B basis
- Taxes ever paid on $99B gain: $0

**This is legal. This is intentional. This ends now.**

## Tax-Exempt Organization Reform: Church Taxation and 501(c)(3) Restructuring

### Executive Rationale

The current tax-exempt framework allows churches and other 501(c)(3) organizations to accumulate vast wealth, operate as businesses, and engage in political activity while paying no taxes. **Churches must be taxed at the same rate as any other for-profit business.** Tax-exempt status will be reserved for organizations that demonstrate genuine charitable purpose by **distributing at least 67% of their annual revenue** (not profit—revenue) to direct charitable activities.

This reform achieves three critical objectives:
1. **Tax fairness:** Churches operating as businesses pay taxes like businesses
2. **Genuine charity:** Only organizations actually serving communities get tax exemption
3. **Revenue generation:** $30-50 billion annually in new federal revenue

### Legal and Constitutional Framework

**Constitutional Authority:**
- **16th Amendment:** Congress has unlimited power to tax income "from whatever source derived"
- **Article I, Section 8:** Congress has plenary taxation power
- **No constitutional requirement for religious tax exemption:** Tax exemption is a legislative grace, not a constitutional mandate (see *Walz v. Tax Commission*, 397 U.S. 664 (1970) - tax exemption permitted but not required)

**Statutory Authority:**
- **26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3):** Congress has full authority to define "charitable" organizations and conditions for exemption
- **26 U.S.C. § 511-514:** Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) already taxes some church commercial activities
- Treasury/IRS has regulatory authority to enforce tax code (26 U.S.C. § 7805)

**Legal Precedent:**
- Churches already lose exemption for excessive political activity (26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3))
- Exemption conditioned on "exclusively" charitable purpose—Congress defines "exclusively"
- No Free Exercise Clause barrier: Neutral tax rules of general applicability valid (*Employment Division v. Smith*, 494 U.S. 872 (1990))

### Documented Abuse: Why Reform Is Necessary

The current tax-exempt system is systematically exploited by wealthy churches and religious organizations that operate as profit-generating businesses, accumulate vast wealth, engage in political activity, and provide minimal charitable services to their communities—all while paying zero taxes.

#### Mega-Churches Operating as For-Profit Businesses

**Lakewood Church (Houston, TX) - Joel Osteen:**

- **Albums sold:** Millions (tax-free revenue)
- **Concerts:** Sold-out arenas worldwide (revenue tax-exempt)

- **Charitable distribution:** Minimal percentage to actual charity
- **Result:** Entertainment business branded as church

**Elevation Church (Charlotte, NC) - Steven Furtick:**
- **Annual revenue:** $30+ million
- **Pastor's home:** $1.7 million mansion built with church funds
- **Business model:** Book sales, conferences, multi-site expansion
- **Transparency:** Refuses to disclose finances publicly
- **Charitable distribution:** Unknown (no disclosure requirement for churches)
- **Result:** Pastoral enrichment disguised as ministry

**Bethel Church (Redding, CA):**
- **Annual revenue:** $60+ million
- **Business operations:** Bethel Music (record label), School of Supernatural Ministry (tuition: $6,675/year)
- **Real estate holdings:** Extensive property in Redding, CA (all tax-exempt)
- **Charitable distribution:** <10% estimated
- **Result:** Education business + music business + real estate empire, zero taxes

#### Massive Wealth Accumulation Without Charitable Distribution

**The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon Church):**
- **Total assets:** $100-150 billion (est.)
- **Annual tithing revenue:** $7 billion
- **Investment portfolio:** $40+ billion stock portfolio (Ensign Peak Advisors)
- **Real estate holdings:** Billions in commercial real estate, shopping malls, farmland
- **Charitable spending:** Estimated $40 million annually (0.6% of tithing revenue)
- **Scandal:** 2019 whistleblower revealed church accumulated $100B while spending <1% on charity
- **Tax avoided:** Billions annually on investment income
- **Result:** Hedge fund/real estate empire with religious branding, pays zero taxes

**Catholic Church (US operations):**
- **Total assets (US):** $100+ billion estimated
- **Annual revenue:** $170+ billion (includes healthcare, education, parishes)
- **Real estate:** Largest private landowner in US
- **Property tax exemption:** Estimated $10-20 billion annually across all properties
- **Scandals:** Billions paid in sexual abuse settlements (using tax-exempt donations)
- **Charitable distribution:** Varies widely; many dioceses spend majority on administration/salaries
- **Result:** Massive wealth accumulation, minimal accountability

**Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN):**
- **Annual revenue:** $200+ million (at peak)
- **Founders (Paul and Jan Crouch):** Lived in $50M mansions, private jets, luxury perks (all from tax-exempt donations)
- **Business model:** TV network soliciting donations with prosperity gospel messaging
- **Scandals:** IRS investigation for personal benefit, lavish spending
- **Charitable distribution:** Minimal - most revenue to operations, salaries, executive luxury
- **Result:** Media empire enriching executives, zero taxes

**Creflo Dollar Ministries:**
- **Annual revenue:** $70+ million
- **Pastor assets:** $65 million Gulfstream G650 jet (solicited from congregation), multi-million dollar homes
- **Solicitations:** Asked 200,000 followers to donate $300 each for private jet
- **Charitable distribution:** Unknown, likely minimal
- **Result:** Pastoral wealth accumulation disguised as ministry

#### Political Activity Violations (Unenforced)

Churches are prohibited from engaging in political campaign activity under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3). **This prohibition is systematically violated with near-zero enforcement.**

**Evangelical Churches and Trump Endorsements (2016-2024):**
- **Hundreds of pastors** openly endorsed Donald Trump from pulpits (illegal)
- **"Pulpit Freedom Sunday":** Annual event where churches deliberately violate law by endorsing candidates
- **IRS enforcement:** Effectively zero - Trump's 2017 executive order directed IRS not to enforce
- **Examples:**
  - Pastor Robert Jeffress (First Baptist Dallas): Repeated Trump endorsements during services
  - Pastor Paula White: Trump's "spiritual advisor," held campaign events in churches
  - Thousands of churches: Distributed voter guides clearly favoring Republican candidates
- **Tax consequences:** NONE - despite clear violations

**Catholic Church Anti-Abortion Political Activity:**
- **Bishops threatening politicians:** Denied communion to pro-choice Catholic politicians (Biden, Pelosi, Kerry)
- **Voter guides:** Distributed materials clearly designed to favor anti-abortion candidates
- **Homilies:** Political messaging on abortion, same-sex marriage, contraception
- **Result:** Political activity under guise of "religious teaching"

**Black Churches and Political Organizing:**
- **Note:** Enforcement would be neutral, but Black churches have also engaged in political activity (hosting candidates, voter drives explicitly for Democratic candidates)
- **Difference:** Black churches often provide substantial community services (food banks, job programs, housing assistance) that offset political activity
- **Point:** Enforcement must be content-neutral but currently is non-existent across ideological spectrum

**Result:** Tax-exempt status is supposed to prohibit political campaign activity. Law is ignored. Churches operate as partisan political organizations while paying no taxes.

#### "Prosperity Gospel" Fraud and Abuse

**Kenneth Copeland Ministries:**
- **Annual revenue:** $300+ million
- **Personal assets:** $750+ million personal net worth
- **Aircraft fleet:** Multiple private jets including $20M+ Gulfstream V
- **Homes:** $6+ million lakefront mansion
- **Message:** "Seed faith" doctrine (give money to get rich)
- **Victims:** Low-income followers give money they can't afford, enriching pastor
- **Charitable aid:** Minimal
- **Tax avoided:** Hundreds of millions in personal income taxes (compensated through church)

**Jesse Duplantis Ministries:**
- **Private jet solicitation:** Asked followers for $54 million Dassault Falcon 7X jet
- **Justification:** "Jesus wouldn't be riding a donkey" if he were here today
- **Revenue:** $20+ million annually
- **Result:** Tax-exempt donations fund extravagant lifestyle

**Benny Hinn Ministries:**
- **Annual revenue:** $100+ million (at peak)
- **Lifestyle:** Private jets, luxury hotels, $10M mansion
- **Healing fraud:** Unverified miracle claims used to solicit donations
- **Scandals:** Financial investigations, lavish spending revelations
- **Result:** Fraud disguised as faith, zero taxes

#### Churches as Real Estate Empires

**Tax-Exempt Property Accumulation:**

**Problem:** Churches buy vast real estate holdings, pay no property taxes, generate revenue through commercial use.

**New York City Example:**
- **Trinity Church Wall Street:** Owns $6 billion in Manhattan real estate
- **Property holdings:** Office buildings, commercial real estate (rented to businesses)
- **Revenue:** Tens of millions annually from commercial rents
- **Property tax avoided:** Estimated $50-100 million annually
- **Charitable distribution:** Provides some social services but holds billions in assets

**Scientology:**
- **Property holdings:** Hundreds of millions in real estate worldwide
- **Los Angeles:** Massive properties on Hollywood Boulevard and throughout city
- **Clearwater, FL:** Owns 60+ properties, dominates downtown (all tax-exempt)
- **Business model:** Real estate acquisition and appreciation
- **Charitable distribution:** Minimal (organization classified as church for tax purposes despite operating as business)
- **Result:** Real estate empire paying zero property taxes while cities lose revenue

#### The IRS "Church Audit" Shield

**26 U.S.C. § 7611 - Special Restrictions on Church Audits:**

Current law imposes unique restrictions on IRS church examinations:
- **IRS must have "reasonable belief"** of violations BEFORE starting audit (no other nonprofits get this protection)
- **High-level approval required:** Regional IRS commissioner must personally approve church audit
- **Notice requirements:** Church must be notified in advance, can challenge in court
- **Limited scope:** Even when approved, audits restricted in scope

**Result:** Churches face virtually ZERO audit risk

**Statistics:**
- **All 501(c)(3) organizations:** ~1.5 million
- **Churches/religious orgs:** ~350,000
- **Church audits per year (2010-2020 avg):** <10
- **Audit rate for churches:** 0.003%
- **Audit rate for other 501(c)(3)s:** 0.5-1% (still low, but 300x higher than churches)

**Why This Matters:**
Churches can accumulate wealth, violate political restrictions, operate businesses, enrich pastors—all with near-certainty they will never face IRS scrutiny. This is systemic abuse enabled by special legal protection.

#### The Scale of Tax Avoidance

**Federal Income Tax Lost:**
- **All 501(c)(3) revenue:** $2.26 trillion annually
- **Religious organizations:** $147 billion annually
- **If taxed at 21% corporate rate (realistic effective rate ~14%):** $20 billion annually lost
- **If includes hospitals/universities not serving charitable purpose:** $70+ billion lost

**Property Tax Lost (State/Local):**
- **Church-owned property value:** Estimated $600+ billion
- **Property tax rate (avg nationwide):** ~1.1%
- **Annual property tax avoided:** $6-8 billion
- **If includes all religious property (including Catholic/Mormon holdings):** $10-20 billion annually lost

**Examples of What This Money Could Fund:**
- $20 billion = 400,000 teachers at $50k/year
- $20 billion = Healthcare for 4 million uninsured Americans
- $20 billion = Free community college for 2 million students
- $20 billion = Housing vouchers for 500,000 families

**Instead:** Tax-exempt donations fund private jets, mansions, real estate empires, political campaigns.

#### Why Current System Fails

**No Distribution Requirement:**
- **Private foundations** must distribute 5% of assets annually (26 U.S.C. § 4942)
- **Churches and 501(c)(3)s** have ZERO distribution requirement
- **Result:** Can accumulate wealth indefinitely (see Mormon Church $100B)

**No Financial Disclosure:**
- **All 501(c)(3)s** must file Form 990 disclosing finances
- **Churches are exempt** from Form 990 requirement
- **Result:** Complete financial opacity - no one knows where money goes

**No Enforcement:**
- **Political activity violations:** Rarely investigated, never prosecuted
- **Excessive compensation:** IRS lacks tools to review pastoral salaries
- **Commercial activity:** UBIT rarely enforced
- **Church audit restrictions:** Make investigations nearly impossible

**Perverse Incentives:**
- **Mega-churches maximize revenue, minimize charitable spending** (accumulate wealth)
- **Pastors compensate themselves lavishly** (no accountability)
- **Real estate empires grow** (property tax-free)
- **Political activity rampant** (no enforcement)
- **"Prosperity gospel" fraud unchecked** (prey on vulnerable)

### The New Framework: 67% Distribution Requirement

**Core Reform:** Tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) requires organizations distribute **at least 67% of gross annual revenue** to direct charitable activities, not merely 67% of net income.

**What Qualifies as "Direct Charitable Activities":**

*Qualifying Distributions (count toward 67%):*
- Direct assistance to needy individuals (food, housing, healthcare)
- Educational programs open to the public (not limited to religious members)
- Community services (addiction recovery, job training, childcare)
- Disaster relief and humanitarian aid
- Medical care and public health services
- Scientific research for public benefit
- Environmental conservation efforts
- Programs that benefit disadvantaged populations

*Non-Qualifying Expenditures (do NOT count toward 67%):*
- Salaries and benefits for clergy/staff
- Building maintenance, utilities, rent
- Administrative overhead
- Religious worship activities (services, ceremonies, rituals)
- Member-only programs and services
- Capital campaigns and property acquisition
- Investment management fees
- Lobbying and political activities
- Marketing and fundraising costs
- Proselytizing and missionary work focused on conversion rather than material aid

**67% Threshold Calculation:**
```
Qualifying Charitable Distribution Percentage =
    (Direct Charitable Expenditures) / (Gross Annual Revenue) × 100

If percentage ≥ 67% → Tax-exempt status maintained
If percentage < 67% → Organization taxed as regular for-profit entity
```

**Example Applications:**

*Mega-Church Scenario:*
- Gross annual revenue: $50 million
- Salaries/benefits: $15 million
- Building/utilities: $10 million
- Worship services: $8 million
- Member programs: $5 million
- Direct charitable aid: $12 million
- **Charitable distribution: 24%** → LOSES tax exemption, taxed as for-profit

*Community Food Bank:*
- Gross annual revenue: $5 million
- Administrative costs: $800,000
- Food distribution: $3.5 million
- Job training programs: $600,000
- **Charitable distribution: 82%** → MAINTAINS tax exemption

*Hospital System:*
- Gross annual revenue: $500 million
- Administrative/overhead: $100 million
- Uncompensated/charity care: $50 million
- Community health programs: $15 million
- Medical education: $185 million (if open-enrollment)
- **Charitable distribution: 50%** → LOSES tax exemption (under 67%)

### Implementation and Enforcement

**IRS Enforcement Mechanism:**

*Year 1: Rulemaking and Notification*
- Treasury issues proposed regulations defining 67% distribution requirement
- 90-day public comment period
- Final regulations published
- All 501(c)(3) organizations notified of new requirements
- 12-month transition period before enforcement begins

*Year 2+: Annual Compliance*
- **Form 990 revision:** New Schedule for detailed charitable distribution reporting
- Organizations must document:
  - Gross revenue (all sources)
  - Qualifying charitable expenditures (itemized)
  - Percentage calculation
  - Certification by independent CPA (for organizations >$1M revenue)
- IRS conducts **stratified random audits:**
  - 100% audit rate for organizations >$50M revenue
  - 25% audit rate for organizations $10-50M revenue
  - 10% audit rate for organizations $1-10M revenue
  - 2% audit rate for organizations <$1M revenue

*Enforcement Actions:*
- **Failure to meet 67% threshold:**
  - Immediate loss of tax-exempt status
  - Organization taxed as C-corporation at standard corporate rates (21% federal)
  - All income subject to federal income tax
  - Property tax exemption also revoked (coordination with state/local)
  - Ability to receive tax-deductible donations eliminated
  - No retroactive recapture of past exemptions (prospective only)

- **Fraud or material misrepresentation:**
  - Criminal tax evasion charges (26 U.S.C. § 7201)
  - Civil penalties up to 75% of underpayment (26 U.S.C. § 6663)
  - Organizational leadership personal liability
  - Permanent bar from tax-exempt status

**Appeals Process:**
- Administrative appeal to IRS Office of Appeals
- Tax Court review available (26 U.S.C. § 7428)
- Organizations bear burden of proving charitable distribution meets 67%
- Good faith compliance safe harbor for first 2 years (warning + corrective action required)

### Church-Specific Provisions

**Elimination of "Church Audit Procedures" Special Treatment:**

Currently, 26 U.S.C. § 7611 imposes special restrictions on IRS church audits, requiring high-level approval and "reasonable belief" of violations. **This special treatment must end.**

*Legislative Amendment Required:*
- **Repeal 26 U.S.C. § 7611** ("Restrictions on church tax inquiries and examinations")
- Churches audited under same procedures as all other organizations
- No "reasonable belief" pre-audit requirement
- Same audit authority IRS has over secular nonprofits
- Rationale: No constitutional requirement for special church audit procedures; religious neutrality requires equal treatment

**No Religious Exemptions from Distribution Requirement:**
- Churches claiming worship services as "charitable" must show direct community benefit beyond member services
- "Charitable" must benefit public or disadvantaged populations, not merely congregation members
- Religious hospitals, schools, and social services qualify IF they serve general public and meet 67% threshold
- Proselytizing activities (missionary work, evangelism) do NOT qualify as charitable unless coupled with material aid meeting community needs

### Revenue Projections and Economic Impact

**Estimated New Federal Revenue:**

*Current Tax-Exempt Organization Revenue:*
- All 501(c)(3) organizations: $2.26 trillion annual revenue
- Religious organizations: $147 billion annual revenue
- Hospitals/healthcare: $1.2 trillion annual revenue
- Educational institutions: $660 billion annual revenue

*Organizations Likely to Lose Exemption:*
- **Mega-churches and wealthy congregations:** 40% fail 67% threshold → $59B taxable revenue
- **Religious organizations accumulating wealth:** 35% fail → $51B taxable revenue
- **Hospital systems with low charity care:** 25% fail → $300B taxable revenue
- **Elite universities with massive endowments:** 15% fail → $99B taxable revenue

*Conservative Revenue Estimate:*
- New taxable revenue: $509 billion
- Federal corporate tax rate: 21%
- **Annual new federal revenue: $107 billion**

*Realistic Revenue Estimate (accounting for deductions/offsets):*
- Effective tax rate after deductions: ~14%
- **Annual new federal revenue: $71 billion**

*Lower-Bound Estimate (aggressive compliance/restructuring):*
- Organizations restructure to meet 67% threshold or reduce revenue
- 40% of potential taxable revenue avoided through compliance
- **Annual new federal revenue: $43 billion**

**Best estimate: $30-50 billion annually in new federal revenue**, with $40-60 billion additional state/local property tax revenue.

### State and Local Coordination

**Property Tax Implications:**

*Federal-State Coordination:*
- Treasury issues model state legislation for 67% threshold property tax exemption
- Federal tax-exempt determination creates rebuttable presumption for state property tax
- Organizations losing federal exemption presumptively lose state/local exemption
- Estimated **$40-60 billion annual new state/local property tax revenue**

*Impact on Major Property Holders:*
- Catholic Church (largest property holder): Extensive property tax liability for churches not meeting 67% threshold
- Mormon Church ($100B+ assets): Significant property tax liability
- Mega-church campuses: Property taxes on facilities primarily serving members rather than community

### Addressing Anticipated Objections

**Q: Doesn't this violate Free Exercise of Religion?**

A: No. *Employment Division v. Smith* (1990) held neutral laws of general applicability do not violate Free Exercise Clause even if they burden religious practice. Tax laws are quintessentially neutral laws of general application. Churches remain free to practice religion; they simply must pay taxes like other entities if they don't meet charitable distribution threshold. No constitutional right to tax exemption exists.

**Q: Won't churches close and communities lose services?**

A: Churches providing genuine charitable services (food banks, homeless shelters, community health clinics) will easily meet the 67% threshold and maintain exemption. Churches primarily serving their own congregants and accumulating wealth will pay taxes—as they should. If a church's "service" to the community is so minimal it can't meet 67%, it's operating as a private club, not a charity.

**Q: What about small churches that can't afford compliance costs?**

A: Organizations under $1 million annual revenue face only 2% audit rates and can use simplified Form 990-EZ. Genuine small community churches serving their neighborhoods will meet the threshold. Small churches accumulating wealth rather than serving communities should pay taxes.

**Q: Isn't 67% too high? Why not 50%?**

A: 67% ensures organizations are *primarily* charitable. At 50%, an organization could spend more on overhead/salaries/facilities than on charity and still claim exemption. The threshold must be high enough that tax exemption is reserved for entities substantially dedicated to public benefit. Private foundations already face similar distribution requirements (26 U.S.C. § 4942 requires 5% of assets distributed annually—our 67% of revenue is more generous).

**Q: Will this reduce charitable giving?**

A: Evidence suggests no. Tax exemption benefits organizations, not donors (donors can still deduct contributions from income taxes even if the receiving organization pays corporate tax on its revenue). Organizations genuinely serving communities will meet the threshold. Those that don't meet the threshold weren't providing sufficient charitable value to justify tax subsidy.

Congress has full authority under existing constitutional taxation powers. This is ordinary legislation requiring simple majority (reconciliation-eligible as tax legislation).

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Framework for Tax Reform

### Constitutional Authority for Wealth and Income Taxation

**The 16th Amendment (1913):**
> "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration."

**Key Points:**
- "From whatever source derived" gives Congress **broad definitional power** over what constitutes income
- Congress has historically defined income expansively (wages, dividends, interest, royalties, prizes, etc.)
- The question of whether unrealized gains can be taxed as income is NOT settled against Congress
- Congress has already taxed unrealized gains in multiple contexts (mark-to-market for dealers, PFICs, Section 1256 contracts)

**Article I, Section 8, Clause 1:**
> "The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises..."

This grants Congress plenary power over taxation, subject only to specific constitutional limitations.

### *Moore v. United States* (2024): The Door Remains Open

**Case Background:**
Charles and Kathleen Moore challenged the Mandatory Repatriation Tax (MRT) under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which taxed their unrealized share of a foreign corporation's accumulated profits.

**What the Court Held:**
- The MRT was constitutional as applied
- The Court did NOT rule that unrealized gains can never be taxed
- The Court explicitly declined to adopt a "realization requirement" as constitutional rule
- Justice Kavanaugh's majority opinion stated the Court was not addressing "taxes on unrealized sums"

**What This Means:**
- The door to taxing unrealized gains remains OPEN
- Congress has authority to define income broadly
- A billionaire minimum tax on unrealized gains has NOT been ruled unconstitutional
- The constitutional question would be decided by a future Court—after potential expansion

### The "Realization" Argument and Why It Fails

**The Conservative Argument:**
*Eisner v. Macomber* (1920) defined income as "gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined" and stated it must be "realized." Therefore, unrealized gains cannot be income.

**Why This Argument Fails:**

1. ***Eisner* is narrowly limited:** The case only addressed stock dividends, not wealth taxation generally. Subsequent cases have repeatedly limited its scope.

2. **Congress already taxes unrealized gains:**
   - IRC § 475: Dealers mark-to-market annually
   - IRC § 1256: Regulated futures contracts marked annually
   - PFIC rules: Passive foreign investment companies
   - Constructive receipt doctrine: Income taxed when available, not when received
   - Original Issue Discount: Interest taxed before received

3. **The Constitution doesn't require realization:**
   - "Realization" is a tax accounting convention, not a constitutional mandate
   - 16th Amendment says "income from whatever source derived"—no realization language
   - Congress defines income; courts defer to reasonable definitions

4. ***Moore* didn't adopt realization requirement:**
   - The Court explicitly avoided ruling on whether realization is constitutionally required
   - Multiple justices noted this was not decided

5. **Wealth tax alternative:**
   - Even if unrealized gains can't be "income," a direct wealth tax may be constitutional as an excise or under the General Welfare Clause
   - Or Congress can apportion the tax among states if necessary

### Legal Precedents Supporting Tax Reform

**Supporting Taxation of Unrealized Gains:**
- *Helvering v. Horst* (1940): Economic benefit = income, even without cash receipt
- *Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass* (1955): Income includes all "accessions to wealth"
- *Cottage Savings v. Commissioner* (1991): Realization can occur in many ways
- *Moore v. United States* (2024): Court declined to constitutionalize realization requirement

**Supporting Wealth Taxation:**
- *Brushaber v. Union Pacific* (1916): 16th Amendment eliminates apportionment requirement for income taxes
- *Fernandez v. Wiener* (1945): Congress has broad power to define taxable transactions
- Historical precedent: Property taxes, estate taxes, and excise taxes are all forms of wealth taxation

## Part III: Comprehensive Tax Reform Agenda

### Reform I: Billionaire Minimum Tax (30-35%)

**The Problem:**
Billionaires use the "buy, borrow, die" strategy to avoid ever paying income tax on their wealth accumulation. Warren Buffett pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. The 25 richest Americans paid an average 3.4% effective tax rate from 2014-2018.

**Policy Design:**

**Rate:** 30-35% minimum tax on "Total Economic Income"

**Total Economic Income Definition:**
```
Total Economic Income =
    Adjusted Gross Income (traditional)
  + Unrealized Gains on Tradable Assets (mark-to-market)
  + Imputed Return on Non-Tradable Assets (5% deemed return)
  - Realized Losses (carryback available)
```

**Threshold:** Applies to taxpayers with **$100 million or more** in total assets

**Treatment of Different Asset Types:**

| Asset Type | Valuation Method | Annual Treatment |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| Publicly traded stock | Market price (12/31) | Mark-to-market annually |
| Bonds, derivatives | Market price or model | Mark-to-market annually |
| Private business interests | Formula (revenue + earnings + assets) | 5% imputed return OR deferred with interest |
| Real estate | Appraisal (every 3 years) | 5% imputed return OR deferred with interest |
| Art, collectibles | Professional appraisal | 5% imputed return OR deferred with interest |
| Retirement accounts | Exempt until distribution | Standard rules apply |

**Liquidity Provisions:**
- **10-year installment option:** Taxpayers can elect to pay minimum tax liability over 10 years
- **Loss carryback:** If asset values decline, prior year taxes can be carried back 5 years
- **Election for non-tradable assets:** Choose between 5% imputed return (annual) OR defer taxation until realization with interest (currently ~5% annually)
- **Hardship exception:** Treasury can grant relief for demonstrable liquidity crisis (unlikely for billionaires with access to credit)

**Example: Billionaire with $50 Billion Net Worth**
- Stock portfolio: $40 billion (mark-to-market)
- Private business: $8 billion (5% imputed return = $400M)
- Real estate: $2 billion (5% imputed return = $100M)
- Assuming 10% stock appreciation: $4 billion unrealized gain
- Total Economic Income: $4B (stock) + $400M (business) + $100M (real estate) = $4.5 billion
- Minimum Tax (30%): $1.35 billion
- Current system: Likely $0 (no realization)

**Who Is Affected:**
- Approximately 700 billionaires in the United States
- Approximately 10,000-20,000 taxpayers with $100M+ net worth
- These taxpayers hold approximately $5+ trillion in wealth
- Current effective tax rates: 3-8%
- New effective tax rates: 25-35%

**Constitutional Defense:**
1. 16th Amendment permits taxation of income "from whatever source derived"
2. *Moore v. United States* (2024) did NOT rule that unrealized gains cannot be income
3. Congress already taxes unrealized gains (mark-to-market) for dealers, futures, PFICs
4. Court has consistently deferred to Congress on tax definitions
5. With expanded Supreme Court (see Chapter 31), constitutional challenge less likely to succeed

**Revenue Estimate:** $250-400 billion over 10 years ($25-40 billion annually)

---

### Reform II: Capital Gains Taxed as Ordinary Income

**The Problem:**
The preferential capital gains rate (currently 20% + 3.8% NIIT = 23.8% maximum vs. 37% + 3.8% = 40.8% for ordinary income) creates a massive tax advantage for the wealthy, who derive most of their income from investments rather than wages.

**Who Benefits from Preferential Rates:**
- Top 1%: Receive 75% of all capital gains
- Top 0.1%: Receive 50% of all capital gains
- Hedge fund managers, private equity partners
- Real estate investors
- Wealthy heirs (who also get stepped-up basis)

**Who Pays Higher Rates:**
- Workers earning wages (taxed at ordinary rates)
- Teachers, nurses, firefighters, police officers
- Small business employees
- Everyone who works for a living

**Policy Design:**

**Core Reform:** Tax long-term capital gains as ordinary income for gains above $1 million annually.

**Structure:**
| Annual Capital Gains | Tax Rate |
|---------------------|----------|
| $0 - $1,000,000 | Current preferential rates preserved |
| Over $1,000,000 | Ordinary income rates (up to 37% + 3.8% NIIT) |

**Phase-In:**
- Year 1: Gains over $1M taxed at 28%
- Year 2: Gains over $1M taxed at 33%
- Year 3+: Gains over $1M taxed as ordinary income (37% + 3.8%)

**Protections for Middle Class:**
- $1 million threshold protects small investors, retirees selling homes
- Primary residence exclusion ($500K for couples) preserved
- Retirement account distributions follow existing rules
- Small business stock exemption (Section 1202) preserved for genuine startups

**Elimination of Stepped-Up Basis:**
The capital gains reform must include elimination of stepped-up basis at death:
- **Current law:** Heirs receive assets at current market value, erasing all prior gains
- **Reform:** Heirs receive assets at decedent's original basis (carryover basis)
- **Alternative:** Treat death as realization event (capital gains tax due at death)
- **Exemption:** First $5 million in gains at death exempt to protect family farms/businesses

**Legal Basis:**
- IRC Section 1(h) establishes preferential rates; Congress can amend at any time
- No constitutional requirement for preferential capital gains rate
- Prior rates: 35% (1970s), 28% (pre-1997)
- Congress has complete authority

**Revenue Estimate:** $200+ billion over 10 years ($20 billion annually)

---

### Reform III: Wealth Tax

**The Problem:**
Wealth inequality is even more extreme than income inequality. The wealthiest Americans have accumulated fortunes so vast they can never be spent—yet pay minimal taxes because wealth itself isn't taxed, only income derived from it (which they avoid through "buy, borrow, die").

**The Scale of Wealth Concentration:**
- Top 0.1% (130,000 families): $19 trillion in wealth
- Top 1% (1.3 million families): $44 trillion in wealth
- Bottom 50% (65 million families): $3.5 trillion (combined)
- Three individuals own more than 165 million Americans combined

**Policy Design:**

**Structure:**
| Net Worth | Annual Tax Rate |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Under $50 million | 0% (exempt) |
| $50 million - $1 billion | 2% annually |
| Over $1 billion | 3% annually |

**Valuation Rules:**
- **Publicly traded securities:** Market value on December 31
- **Real estate:** County assessment with federal adjustment factor (median ratio to sale price)
- **Private business interests:** Formula based on revenue (2x), earnings (10x), and net assets (1x), averaged
- **Art, collectibles, other assets:** Professional appraisal (owner pays); IRS Art Advisory Panel for high-value items
- **Retirement accounts:** Excluded from wealth tax base
- **Primary residence:** First $5 million excluded

**Anti-Avoidance Provisions:**
- **Exit tax:** 40% tax on unrealized gains if taxpayer expatriates to avoid wealth tax
- **Covered expatriate:** Anyone with $50M+ net worth who renounces citizenship or long-term residency
- **Look-through rules:** Trust assets attributed to settlors/beneficiaries
- **Anti-stuffing:** Transfers to family members within 5 years of wealth tax effective date included
- **IRS valuation authority:** Treasury can challenge unreasonable valuations

**Constitutional Analysis:**

The wealth tax faces a constitutional question: Is it a "direct tax" requiring apportionment among states?

**Arguments AGAINST Constitutionality:**
- Article I, Section 9: "No capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census"
- *Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.* (1895): Taxes on income from property are direct taxes
- A wealth tax is arguably a "direct tax" on property

**Arguments FOR Constitutionality:**
1. **Historical understanding:** "Direct tax" historically meant only head taxes and taxes on land
2. ***Pollock* was wrongly decided:** The 16th Amendment shows Congress rejected Pollock's reasoning
3. **Wealth tax as excise:** Tax on the "privilege" of holding extreme wealth (excises are not direct)
4. **Apportionment is possible:** If required, wealth tax could be apportioned (complex but possible)
5. **Annual wealth accumulation IS income:** If structured as tax on annual increase in wealth, 16th Amendment applies

**Strategic Approach:**
- Pass the wealth tax legislatively
- Anticipate constitutional challenge
- With expanded Supreme Court (Chapter 31), challenge more likely to fail
- If Court strikes down, try alternative structures (apportioned or income-based)

**Revenue Estimate:** $300 billion annually

**Example: Billionaire with $100 Billion Net Worth**
- First $50 million: Exempt
- $50M - $1B: $950M × 2% = $19 million
- Over $1B: $99B × 3% = $2.97 billion
- **Total annual wealth tax: $2.989 billion**
- Current wealth tax paid: $0

---

### Reform IV: Corporate Tax Reform

**The Problem:**
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act slashed the corporate rate from 35% to 21%, delivering hundreds of billions to shareholders while corporations increasingly paid nothing through loopholes.

**Corporate Tax Avoidance Examples:**
- Amazon: $0 federal income tax in 2018 on $11 billion profit
- Netflix: $0 federal income tax in 2018 on $845 million profit
- Chevron: $0 federal income tax in 2018 on $4.5 billion profit
- 55 major corporations paid $0 federal income tax in 2020 on $40 billion combined profits

**Policy Design:**

**1. Raise Corporate Tax Rate:**
- **Current rate:** 21%
- **New rate:** 28%
- **Historical context:** Rate was 35% before 2017, 52% in 1960s
- **International comparison:** Still competitive with developed nations

**2. Global Minimum Tax Implementation (OECD Pillar Two):**
- **Rate:** 15% global minimum tax on multinational profits
- **Mechanism:** If foreign subsidiaries pay less than 15%, U.S. taxes the difference
- **Impact:** Ends profit shifting to tax havens (Ireland, Netherlands, Bermuda, Cayman)
- **GILTI Strengthening:** Raise GILTI rate to 15% country-by-country (currently 10.5% blended)

**3. Stock Buyback Alternative Minimum Tax:**
- **Current law:** 1% excise tax on stock buybacks (Inflation Reduction Act)
- **Reform:** Increase to 4% OR alternative minimum tax structure
- **Rationale:** Corporations using profits for buybacks instead of workers/investment should pay

**4. Eliminate Specific Loopholes:**
- **FDII deduction:** Repeal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction (encourages IP offshoring)
- **Accelerated depreciation:** Phase out 100% bonus depreciation for equipment
- **Interest deduction:** Tighten Section 163(j) limits on interest deductions
- **BEAT strengthening:** Expand Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax to more companies

**5. Country-by-Country Reporting:**
- **Requirement:** All multinationals publicly disclose profits, taxes, and employees by country
- **Transparency:** Enables public scrutiny of profit shifting
- **Model:** EU already requires this for banks

**Legal Basis:** IRC Section 11; Congress has complete authority to set corporate rates and define corporate income.

**Revenue Estimate:** $150 billion annually

---

### Reform V: Carried Interest Loophole Closure

**The Problem:**
Hedge fund managers and private equity partners receive their compensation as "carried interest"—a share of investment profits. Despite this being compensation for their labor, it's taxed at the 20% capital gains rate instead of the 37% ordinary income rate.

**How It Works:**
- Private equity fund manager contributes 2% of fund capital
- Manager entitled to 20% of profits ("2 and 20" structure)
- That 20% profit share is "carried interest"
- Taxed as capital gain (20%) instead of ordinary income (37%)
- Managers doing the same work as employees pay half the tax rate

**Example:**
- Fund profit: $1 billion
- Manager's carried interest (20%): $200 million
- Tax if ordinary income: $74 million
- Tax as capital gain: $40 million
- **Tax savings from loophole: $34 million**

**Who Benefits:**
- Private equity partners (KKR, Blackstone, Carlyle, Apollo)
- Hedge fund managers
- Venture capital partners
- Real estate fund managers
- Estimated 50,000 individuals

**Policy Design:**

**Core Reform:** Recharacterize carried interest as ordinary income.

**Structure:**
- All carried interest treated as compensation for services
- Taxed at ordinary income rates (up to 37% + 3.8% NIIT)
- No grandfather for existing arrangements
- Exception: Only if manager has significant personal capital at risk (>50% of fund commitment)

**Effective Date:** Immediate upon enactment (no transition period—this loophole has been debated for 20 years)

**Legal Basis:** Treasury already has regulatory authority to recharacterize carried interest. Legislation provides certainty.

**Revenue Estimate:** $15-20 billion over 10 years

---

### Reform VI: Offshore Tax Haven Crackdown

**The Problem:**
Wealthy Americans hide an estimated $300+ billion in offshore tax havens, using complex structures involving shell companies, trust arrangements, and complicit banks and advisors.

**Scale of Offshore Tax Evasion:**
- Estimated $8-10 trillion in U.S. wealth held offshore
- $300+ billion in annual tax revenue lost
- Swiss banks, Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, Pandora Papers revelations
- Enablers (banks, lawyers, accountants) rarely prosecuted

**Policy Design:**

**1. FATCA Enhancement:**
- **Lower reporting thresholds:** From $50,000 to $10,000 for foreign accounts
- **Expand covered institutions:** Include crypto exchanges, fintech platforms
- **Increase penalties:** Willful FBAR violations from $100,000 to $500,000 per account
- **Automatic exchange expansion:** Require FATCA partners to provide more detailed information

**2. Common Reporting Standard (CRS) Full Implementation:**
- **Join CRS:** Currently 100+ countries exchange tax information; U.S. receives but doesn't send
- **Reciprocity:** Provide information to treaty partners (reduces U.S. as tax haven for foreigners)
- **Impact:** Complete picture of offshore holdings

**3. Beneficial Ownership Registry (Corporate Transparency Act Implementation):**
- **Aggressive implementation:** Full enforcement of 2021 Corporate Transparency Act
- **Lower thresholds:** Require disclosure for smaller entities
- **Public access:** Make beneficial ownership information publicly available (not just law enforcement)
- **Penalties:** Increase civil penalties for non-compliance to $10,000/day

**4. Enabler Prosecution:**
- **Criminal liability:** Banks, lawyers, accountants who facilitate offshore evasion face criminal charges
- **Deferred prosecution agreements:** Require cooperation, disgorgement, compliance programs
- **Professional sanctions:** License revocation for lawyers/CPAs facilitating evasion
- **Whistleblower enhancement:** Increase rewards to 30% of recovered taxes

**5. IRS International Enforcement:**
- **Dedicated International Enforcement Unit:** 5,000 specialized agents
- **Transfer pricing audits:** Increased scrutiny of intercompany transactions
- **Treaty renegotiation:** Update tax treaties to prevent treaty shopping
- **Coordination:** Joint enforcement with EU, UK, Australia, Canada

**Day 1 Executive Actions:**
- Treasury directive: Aggressive Corporate Transparency Act implementation
- IRS directive: Priority enforcement on offshore accounts
- DOJ directive: Prosecution of enablers

**Revenue Estimate:** $30 billion annually from enforcement

---

### Reform VII: Estate Tax Strengthening

**The Problem:**
The estate tax has been gutted to the point of irrelevance. Current exemption: $13.6 million per person ($27.2 million per couple). Only 0.1% of estates pay any estate tax. Meanwhile, wealthy families use sophisticated trust structures to transfer billions completely tax-free.

**Current Estate Tax Avoidance Strategies:**

**1. Stepped-Up Basis:**
- All unrealized appreciation ERASED at death
- Heirs receive assets at current market value
- Lifetime of gains completely untaxed
- Estimated cost: $40+ billion annually in lost revenue

**2. Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs):**
- Transfer assets to trust, retain annuity payments
- If assets appreciate faster than IRS-assumed rate, excess passes tax-free
- Waltons (Walmart) transferred $30+ billion through GRATs
- Completely legal, deliberately exploits tax code

**3. Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts (IDGTs):**
- "Sell" assets to trust in exchange for promissory note
- Grantor pays income taxes on trust income (reduces estate)
- Trust appreciation passes to beneficiaries tax-free
- Sheldon Adelson: Transferred $8+ billion through IDGTs

**4. Dynasty Trusts:**
- Assets placed in trust that lasts forever (many states abolished Rule Against Perpetuities)
- Never subject to estate tax across generations
- $1 trillion+ currently in dynasty trusts
- Perpetual aristocracy of wealth

**5. Valuation Discounts:**
- Family limited partnerships: Claim 30-40% discounts for "lack of marketability"
- Minority interest discounts: Claim discount even when family owns 100%
- IRS routinely challenges, often loses or settles

**Policy Design:**

**1. Eliminate Stepped-Up Basis:**
- **Carryover basis:** Heirs receive assets at decedent's original basis
- **Alternative:** Treat death as realization event (pay capital gains at death)
- **Exemption:** First $5 million in unrealized gains exempt (protects family farms/businesses)
- **Spousal exception:** Unlimited transfers to spouse still tax-free

**2. Lower Exemption Amount:**
| Current Law | Reform |
|-------------|--------|
| $13.6 million per person | $3.5 million per person |
| $27.2 million per couple | $7 million per couple |
| 99.9% estates exempt | 99.5% still exempt |

**3. Increase Rates:**
| Taxable Estate | Current Rate | New Rate |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| $0 - $3.5 million | 0% | 0% (exempt) |
| $3.5 million - $50 million | 40% | 45% |
| Over $50 million | 40% | 55% |

**4. Close Trust Loopholes:**

**GRAT Reform:**
- Minimum 10-year term (currently can be 2 years)
- Minimum remainder value (25% of initial contribution)
- Eliminate "zeroed-out" GRATs

**IDGT Reform:**
- Require inclusion of sold assets in grantor's estate
- Treat grantor death as taxable event
- Limit installment sale terms

**Dynasty Trust Reform:**
- Maximum trust duration: 90 years (restore Rule Against Perpetuities)
- Generation-skipping tax on existing dynasty trusts at each generational transfer
- Increase GST tax rate to match estate tax

**Valuation Discount Reform:**
- Eliminate marketability discounts for family-controlled entities
- Eliminate minority discounts when family owns majority
- Look-through rules for entity valuation

**5. Basis Reporting:**
- Require executors to report basis of all transferred assets
- IRS receives information to ensure compliance
- Penalties for inaccurate reporting

**Legal Basis:** IRC Sections 2001-2801; Congress has full authority to set estate tax exemptions, rates, and rules.

**Revenue Estimate:** $100+ billion over 10 years

---

### Reform VIII: IRS Reform and Enforcement

**The Problem:**
The IRS has been systematically defunded and understaffed for decades, making it impossible to enforce tax laws against wealthy taxpayers with armies of lawyers and accountants.

**IRS Enforcement Crisis:**

**Budget and Staffing:**
- IRS budget cut 20% (inflation-adjusted) since 2010
- Enforcement staff reduced from 50,000 to 35,000
- Revenue agents (who audit complex returns) down 40%
- Training and technology severely outdated (1960s-era systems)

**Audit Rate Collapse:**
| Income Level | 2010 Audit Rate | 2020 Audit Rate | Change |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Under $25,000 (EITC) | 1.0% | 0.8% | -20% |
| $200,000 - $500,000 | 1.2% | 0.4% | -67% |
| $1 million+ | 8.4% | 0.7% | -92% |
| $10 million+ | 21.2% | 3.9% | -82% |

**The Result:**
- Millionaires audit rate dropped from 8% to less than 1%
- Wealthy know audits are unlikely—incentive to cheat
- EITC recipients (working poor) audited at similar rates to millionaires
- Tax gap: $600+ billion annually

**Policy Design:**

**1. Restore and Expand IRS Funding:**
- **$80 billion over 10 years** (restore Inflation Reduction Act funding + expand)
- **Inflation-protected:** Automatic COLA adjustments
- **Mandatory spending:** Not subject to annual appropriations cuts

**2. Hire 50,000+ New IRS Personnel:**

| Category | Current | Target | Net Hire |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| Revenue Agents (auditors) | 8,000 | 20,000 | +12,000 |
| Revenue Officers (collectors) | 5,000 | 10,000 | +5,000 |
| Special Agents (criminal) | 2,000 | 4,000 | +2,000 |
| Tax Examiners | 10,000 | 20,000 | +10,000 |
| International Specialists | 1,000 | 5,000 | +4,000 |
| Technology/Data Analysts | 3,000 | 15,000 | +12,000 |
| Support Staff | varies | varies | +5,000 |
| **Total** | ~35,000 | ~85,000 | **+50,000** |

**3. Audit Rate Targets:**

| Income Level | Current | Target |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Under $400,000 | 0.4% | No increase |
| $400,000 - $1 million | 0.5% | 2% |
| $1 million - $10 million | 0.7% | 8% |
| $10 million+ | 3.9% | 15% |
| Large partnerships (>$10M assets) | 0.1% | 10% |
| Large corporations | varies | Comprehensive |

**4. Technology Modernization:**
- Replace 1960s-era mainframe systems
- Implement AI/machine learning for audit selection
- Digital taxpayer services (online accounts, chatbots)
- Real-time payment processing
- Data analytics for fraud detection

**5. Specialized Enforcement Units:**
- **Global High Wealth Program:** Dedicated team for ultra-wealthy (net worth $50M+)
- **Partnership Compliance:** Specialized auditors for pass-through entities
- **International Tax:** Transfer pricing, offshore accounts
- **Cryptocurrency Unit:** Digital asset compliance
- **Fraud Detection:** AI-powered identification of schemes

**6. Taxpayer Services (Not Just Enforcement):**
- Free direct filing option (IRS Free File expansion)
- Improved customer service (answer rates, wait times)
- Taxpayer Advocate expansion
- VITA program support (volunteer tax assistance)
- Plain-language guidance and forms

**Day 1 Executive Action:**
- IRS Commissioner directive: Immediately prioritize high-wealth enforcement
- Announce audit rate targets publicly
- Restore all IRA-funded positions
- Resume hiring surge

**Return on Investment:**
- CBO estimate: Each $1 in IRS enforcement spending yields $5-9 in additional revenue
- $80 billion investment → $400-700 billion in revenue over 10 years
- Conservative estimate: $200+ billion in additional revenue

---

### Reform IX: Carbon Tax and Climate Revenue

**The Problem:**
Carbon pollution imposes massive costs on society—climate damage, health impacts, extreme weather—but polluters pay nothing. This is a market failure of epic proportions.

**The Economics:**
- Social cost of carbon: $50-200+ per ton (damages caused)
- Current price polluters pay: $0 (in most of U.S.)
- Result: Pollution is subsidized; clean alternatives disadvantaged

**Policy Design:**

**1. Carbon Tax Structure:**
- **Starting rate:** $50 per ton CO2 equivalent
- **Annual increase:** $10 per ton per year
- **Trajectory:** $50 → $60 → $70 → $80 → ... (predictable, rising)
- **Coverage:** All fossil fuel combustion and industrial emissions
- **Point of taxation:** Upstream (fuel producers/importers) for simplicity

**2. Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM):**
- **Import fee:** Carbon-intensive imports taxed based on embedded carbon
- **Export rebate:** U.S. exporters rebated carbon costs to maintain competitiveness
- **Covered products:** Steel, aluminum, cement, chemicals, electricity
- **Rationale:** Prevents "carbon leakage" (production moving to non-carbon-pricing countries)
- **WTO compliance:** Designed to be trade-law compliant

**3. Carbon Dividend (Revenue Recycling):**

**Option A - Direct Dividend:**
- 100% of carbon tax revenue returned to households
- Equal per-capita dividend (children count at 0.5)
- Estimated dividend: $2,000-4,000 per family annually
- Progressive: Low-income households receive more than they pay in higher prices
- 70% of households come out ahead

**Option B - Fund Public Investment:**
- Revenue funds climate transition, clean energy, public services
- More transformative but less immediately popular
- Can be combined with partial dividend

**Recommended: 50% dividend / 50% investment**
- Maintains popular support through direct payments
- Funds necessary clean energy transition
- Addresses equity concerns

**4. Fossil Fuel Subsidy Elimination:**

**Subsidies to Repeal:**
| Subsidy | Description | Annual Cost |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Intangible Drilling Costs | Immediate deduction | $2.3B |
| Percentage Depletion | Deduction beyond cost | $1.0B |
| Domestic Manufacturing Deduction | Section 199 for fossil fuels | $1.7B |
| LIFO Accounting | Inventory timing benefit | $1.6B |
| Master Limited Partnerships | Pass-through for fossil fuels | $1.5B |
| Foreign Tax Credit | Credit for foreign royalties | $1.0B |
| Enhanced Oil Recovery Credit | Tax credit for EOR | $0.5B |
| Other federal subsidies | Various | $3-5B |
| **Total Federal** | | **$13-15B** |
| State/local subsidies | Various | $5-10B |
| **Grand Total** | | **$20-25B** |

**Legal Basis:** Congress has full authority to impose taxes, eliminate deductions, and regulate commerce.

**Revenue Estimate:**
