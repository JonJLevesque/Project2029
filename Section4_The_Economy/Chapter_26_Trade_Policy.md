# Chapter 26: Trade Policy

## Executive Summary

The United States trade policy apparatus — anchored by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the rules-based multilateral trading system, and a half-century of negotiated agreements — exists to expand American economic opportunity, enforce fair competition for U.S. producers and workers, and sustain the international partnerships that underpin national security. Trade agreements govern access to $6 trillion in annual goods and services flows. The World Trade Organization (WTO) provides the legal framework within which 164 nations adjudicate disputes, prevent retaliation spirals, and discipline predatory practices. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, authorized under the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. § 2291), was the social compact that made trade liberalization politically sustainable — the promise that workers displaced by competition would receive retraining, income support, and a genuine path back to economic security.

Project 2025 and the Trump administration systematically dismantled this architecture. Beginning in 2025, the administration invoked emergency powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. § 1701) and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. § 1862) to impose the largest across-the-board tariff increases since 1930, triggering retaliatory actions from every major trading partner, shattering the USMCA agreement with Canada and Mexico within months of its implementation, and continuing the WTO Appellate Body paralysis that the United States itself created. The Trump administration eliminated Trade Adjustment Assistance, allowed the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to lapse without renewal, and deployed tariffs not as trade policy instruments but as general-purpose coercion tools for unrelated immigration, drug enforcement, and political goals. The result: the largest goods trade deficit on record ($1.24 trillion in 2025), an average tax increase of $1,500 per American household, 740,000 fewer payroll jobs, and a U.S. economy persistently 0.6 percent smaller than it would otherwise be — equivalent to $170 billion in lost output annually.

This chapter establishes the Project 2029 framework for comprehensive trade policy restoration and transformation. The United States will restore rules-based trade, repair alliance relationships damaged by unilateral tariff aggression, establish a strategic and targeted approach to competition with China, revive and modernize worker protections, and deploy trade policy as an instrument for achieving democratic values — labor rights, environmental standards, and supply chain resilience — rather than as a blunt tool of presidential coercion.

**The Stakes**: American farmers, manufacturers, workers, and exporters paid an estimated $236 billion in tariff revenue through November 2025 — revenue extracted from the American economy, not from foreign governments, and passed through to consumers as higher prices. China retaliated with tariffs reaching 71.5 percent on soybeans, targeting $12.8 billion in annual U.S. agricultural exports. Canada and the European Union imposed countermeasures on billions in U.S. goods. The WTO dispute settlement system — which the United States spent decades building and which serves as the primary legal backstop for American exporters — has been rendered nonfunctional, with 32 panel rulings "appealed into the void" and WTO caseloads reduced to one-third of pre-crisis levels. Every year this dysfunction continues, U.S. exporters lose recourse against foreign unfair trade practices while American consumers pay billions in tariff-driven price increases.

**Key Reforms**:
- Terminate IEEPA-based blanket tariffs applied without trade justification and restore rules-based tariff policy anchored in statutory procedures under the Trade Act of 1974
- Restore WTO Appellate Body functionality by ending the U.S. veto of judicial appointments and engaging multilateral dispute settlement reform
- Implement a strategic China trade policy distinguishing critical security sectors (targeted decoupling) from ordinary commercial competition (engagement)
- Repair the USMCA relationship with Canada and Mexico through diplomatic commitments not to invoke IEEPA for non-trade emergencies against treaty partners
- Enact Trade Adjustment Assistance 2.0 with expanded eligibility, enhanced benefits, and sector-specific workforce development funding
- Renew and reform the Generalized System of Preferences to benefit developing-country partners and reduce dependence on adversarial supply chains
- Establish binding labor rights and environmental standards in all future trade agreements and enforce existing commitments through USMCA labor chapters
- Build supply chain resilience for critical sectors — semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, rare earth elements, and critical minerals — through allied coordination
- Develop a U.S. Climate Border Adjustment mechanism aligned with WTO Article XX environmental exceptions
- Create a Digital Trade Framework addressing data flows, platform regulation, and cross-border e-commerce

**Constitutional and Legal Basis**: Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution vests Congress with exclusive authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and to lay and collect duties. Congressional delegation to the executive branch includes Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. § 1862, Section 232), Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq., including Section 201 safeguard actions and Section 301 unfair trade practices), IEEPA (50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq.), USMCA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. § 4501 et seq.), WTO Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. § 3511), and Trade Adjustment Assistance provisions (19 U.S.C. § 2291 et seq.). The administration will restore the institutional constraints that prevent executive branch abuse of delegated trade authorities.

## Part I: Project 2025 Trade Policy Damage and Destruction

### Trade Policy Before the Damage: What Was at Stake

Before documenting the destruction, the baseline must be understood. American trade policy in the decades before 2025 was built on a coherent institutional architecture:

**The Rules-Based Multilateral System.** The WTO — successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade established in 1947 — provided a framework of binding tariff commitments, national treatment obligations, and enforceable dispute settlement covering 164 nations and nearly all of global trade. The United States was the WTO's founding architect and its primary beneficiary, using dispute settlement to challenge Chinese subsidies, European agricultural policies, and discriminatory treatment of American services exports. American exporters filed more WTO complaints than any other nation precisely because the system worked.

**Preferential Trade Agreements.** The United States maintained 14 free trade agreements covering 20 nations, providing preferential market access for American exporters while securing reciprocal openings for American consumers and investors. USMCA alone governed $1.7 trillion in annual trilateral commerce. These agreements took years of negotiation, required active congressional participation under Trade Promotion Authority, and created dense webs of economic interdependence that enhanced both prosperity and diplomatic relationships.

**Specialized Trade Programs.** The Generalized System of Preferences provided duty-free access for developing countries, supporting their economic development and reducing their dependence on Chinese economic relationships. Trade Adjustment Assistance provided the social compact that made trade liberalization politically sustainable. Section 301 investigations and antidumping/countervailing duty cases gave U.S. producers legal tools to challenge genuine unfair trade practices.

**The Office of the USTR.** A professional, statutorily independent trade negotiating agency housed in the Executive Office of the President, with career expertise spanning trade law, economics, and international relations. USTR served as both the institutional repository of American trade negotiating capacity and the enforcement arm for trade agreement commitments.

Project 2025 targeted every element of this architecture for destruction or subordination.

### The Tariff Blitzkrieg: Blanket Duties Without Statutory Justification

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The Trump administration imposed the most sweeping unilateral tariff regime since the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930 — and did so through executive action rather than the congressionally mandated procedures in existing trade statutes. Beginning January 2025 and escalating through the spring, the administration invoked IEEPA — a national security statute never previously used to impose peacetime tariffs — to apply:

- A 10 percent universal baseline tariff on all imports from all nations, effective April 5, 2025
- Country-specific "reciprocal" tariffs on 57 trading partners, ranging from 11 to 50 percent
- 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, combining IEEPA border security and fentanyl emergency declarations with existing Section 301 duties
- 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from all countries under Section 232

The economic consequences were severe and immediate. By November 2025, the effective U.S. tariff rate reached nearly 17 percent — seven times the January baseline and the highest since 1935. The Tax Foundation calculated that these tariffs constituted the largest U.S. tax increase as a percentage of GDP since 1993. The Budget Lab at Yale found that U.S. real GDP growth was reduced by 1.1 percentage points, with a permanent long-run reduction of 0.6 percent — equivalent to $170 billion annually in foregone output. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis documented that durable goods prices "increased noticeably," with price movements correlating directly with tariff timing.

The congressional intent embedded in the Trade Act of 1974 and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 was that tariff increases of this magnitude require formal investigation, notice-and-comment procedures, injury findings, and in most cases congressional notification or approval. The Trump administration bypassed all of these requirements. IEEPA contains no requirement for economic injury findings, no procedural safeguards, and no mandatory expiration. The administration's use of a 1977 national security statute to implement wholesale industrial tariff policy represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional usurpation of legislative authority.

**The Cost to American Households:**

The average American household paid approximately $1,500 more in 2026 as a direct result of tariff policy enacted in 2025. For households in the middle income quintile, the burden exceeded $1,230 per tax unit annually. Low-income households, which spend a higher share of income on goods subject to tariffs — clothing, electronics, furniture, and food — bore a disproportionately regressive burden.

### The USMCA Betrayal: Tariff Aggression Against Treaty Partners

**What Project 2025 Did:**

On February 1, 2025, the Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, citing fentanyl trafficking and immigration as justifications — uses entirely unrelated to trade. This action directly violated the USMCA, which the Trump administration itself negotiated, signed, and celebrated in 2020. The USMCA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. § 4501) established a legal framework of tariff-free access for qualifying North American goods. IEEPA was invoked to override these treaty obligations, marking the first time in American history that a president used that statute to nullify a trade agreement the United States had ratified.

Canada immediately announced retaliatory tariffs of 25 percent on CA$30 billion (approximately $20.6 billion) in American goods, with warnings of expansion to CA$155 billion ($106 billion). Mexico announced countermeasures targeting U.S. corn, soybeans, and dairy exports. While some USMCA-compliant goods eventually received exemptions on March 6, 2025, the damage was done: the trading relationship underpinning approximately $1.7 trillion in annual trilateral commerce had been destabilized, trust was shattered, and Canada — the United States' largest single trading partner — was alienated toward alternative trading arrangements.

The stated justifications were transparently pretextual. Canada is not a significant source of fentanyl entering the United States. Using trade sanctions against allied nations as leverage for immigration enforcement transforms trade policy into a form of economic coercion against democratic partners, undermines the rules-based international order, and signals to every future U.S. trade partner that agreements with the United States carry no reliable commitment.

### The WTO Destruction: Paralysis by Design

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The United States began blocking WTO Appellate Body judicial appointments in 2019 — a deliberate strategy that by December 2019 had reduced the body below its three-member quorum minimum, rendering it unable to issue binding rulings. The Trump administration in its second term continued and accelerated this blockade. As of September 2025, the United States had vetoed Appellate Body reappointments for the 90th time, standing alone against 130 WTO member nations supporting restoration.

The consequences are systemic and severe. As of April 2025, 32 dispute panel rulings had been "appealed into the void" — meaning losing parties could appeal adverse decisions to a nonfunctional body and thereby escape binding compliance indefinitely. WTO caseloads had plummeted to approximately one-third of pre-crisis levels, as member states concluded that dispute settlement no longer provided effective enforcement. The Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement (MPIA), organized by 53 WTO members as a workaround, explicitly excludes the United States and several major traders — meaning American exporters cannot access its protections.

American exporters of agricultural products, manufactured goods, and services are the primary victims of the Appellate Body collapse. Without effective multilateral enforcement, U.S. producers have no reliable mechanism to challenge foreign subsidies, discriminatory standards, or market access restrictions that violate WTO commitments. The administration's posture — destroying the dispute settlement mechanism the United States built while simultaneously claiming the WTO is biased against American interests — is logically incoherent and strategically self-defeating.

### The China Trade War: Escalation Without Strategy

**What Project 2025 Did:**

The administration escalated tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent — a rate that effectively bans ordinary commerce for most categories of Chinese goods. Chinese retaliation reached 125 percent on U.S. exports. Chinese countermeasures targeted $21 billion in American agricultural products based on 2024 export data, with effective tariff rates on soybeans reaching 71.5 percent, cotton reaching 74 percent, and pork byproducts reaching 99 percent. U.S. soybean exports to China — the single largest U.S. agricultural export at $12.8 billion annually — were effectively severed.

The administration had no coherent strategy for managing the resulting economic dislocation. Rather than pursuing targeted decoupling in sectors with genuine national security implications — semiconductors, advanced telecommunications, biotech, critical minerals — the administration pursued blanket escalation that punished American farmers, retailers, and manufacturers while providing no clear pathway to achieving any defined policy objective. China responded by accelerating import substitution from Brazil, Argentina, and Australia, redirecting trade flows that will not return regardless of future tariff adjustments.

The administration simultaneously allowed the Section 301 enforcement mechanisms established under the Trade Act of 1974 to atrophy, failed to bring China into compliance on the Phase One trade deal's purchase commitment failures, and pursued no bilateral framework for managing competition in emerging technology sectors.

### The Gutting of Trade Adjustment Assistance and Worker Protections

**What Project 2025 Did:**

Trade Adjustment Assistance — the program that has provided income support, retraining, and job search assistance to workers displaced by foreign competition since 1962 — was allowed to lapse in July 2022. The TAA worker program effectively terminated for new claimants. In its FY2026 budget, the Trump administration proposed eliminating the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms (TAAF) program entirely and defunding related Economic Development Administration programs.

This elimination was cynically timed. The administration imposed the most sweeping tariff increases in nearly a century — actions that disrupted supply chains, triggered retaliatory tariffs against U.S. exporters, and caused manufacturing dislocation in sectors that had oriented around integrated North American and global supply chains — while simultaneously eliminating the only federal program designed to assist displaced workers. U.S. payroll employment was 740,000 jobs lower than it would otherwise have been. Corporate bankruptcies reached their highest level since 2010. Workers in manufacturing, agriculture, and export-dependent industries bore these costs with no federal safety net.

The Generalized System of Preferences, which had provided duty-free access for 5,000 products from 119 developing countries and territories, expired on December 31, 2020. By 2025, U.S. importers had paid over $3 billion in duties that would not have been owed under a renewed GSP — costs passed to American consumers — while developing-country partners lost preferential market access, incentivizing reorientation toward Chinese economic relationships.

### The Ideological Foundation: Project 2025's Mercantilist Vision

**What Project 2025 Proposed:**

Project 2025's trade policy vision — articulated in the Heritage Foundation's Mandate for Leadership and implemented by the Trump administration — rests on a mercantilist fallacy: that trade is a zero-sum competition in which every import represents a defeat and every trade deficit represents exploitation. This view, which the economics profession uniformly rejects, treats bilateral trade balances as scorecards of winning and losing rather than the natural consequence of comparative advantage, capital flows, exchange rates, and consumer preferences.

Project 2025's approach calls for using tariffs as all-purpose leverage tools — not as instruments of trade policy with specific trade objectives, but as general coercive weapons to be applied against any nation on any issue regardless of whether that issue has any connection to trade. The document endorses using IEEPA tariff threats against Canada for immigration enforcement, against Mexico for drug interdiction, against the EU for defense burden-sharing, and against China for technology disputes, human rights concerns, and military posture issues simultaneously. This approach destroys the credibility of American trade commitments, teaches every trading partner that U.S. agreements are contingent on compliance with unrelated demands, and eliminates the predictability that markets require to make long-term investment decisions.

The Heritage Foundation's trade vision also calls for undermining the WTO dispute settlement system not because it reforms it toward better rules, but because any multilateral constraint on American unilateral action is treated as an infringement on sovereignty. This approach confuses sovereignty with impunity: the United States built the WTO system precisely because American exporters benefit from binding rules that constrain foreign governments' ability to discriminate against American products. Destroying the enforcement mechanism is not sovereignty enhancement — it is an act of self-harm that benefits only those foreign governments most motivated to discriminate against U.S. goods.

Project 2025 further proposes eliminating or weakening the USTR as an independent institution, subordinating trade negotiations to the broader nationalist foreign policy agenda, and reducing congressional trade oversight authority. Each of these proposals would further concentrate unaccountable trade power in the executive branch, eliminating the institutional safeguards that Congress established precisely to prevent trade policy from becoming an instrument of presidential whim.

### The Human Cost

The aggregate human cost of Project 2025 trade policy is documented and severe:

- 740,000 fewer U.S. payroll jobs by year-end 2025, as employment growth slowed under tariff-driven uncertainty
- Corporate bankruptcies reached their highest level since 2010, disproportionately affecting small and medium manufacturers
- Average American household paid $1,500 more annually due to tariff-driven price increases, with low-income households bearing a disproportionate regressive burden
- U.S. agricultural exports to China lost approximately $21 billion in market access, with soybean exports effectively eliminated through 71.5 percent retaliatory tariffs
- The EU proposed tariffs on $5.3 billion in U.S. agricultural products including soybeans, corn, durum wheat, and rice
- U.S. goods trade deficit reached a record $1.24 trillion in 2025 — the stated tariff policy goal of reducing the trade deficit was not achieved
- The U.S. economy is permanently 0.6 percent smaller than it would be without the 2025 tariff regime, equivalent to $170 billion in annual lost output
- Over $3 billion in excess import duties paid by U.S. companies due to GSP lapse, 2021-2023

## Part II: Legal and Constitutional Foundations

### Constitutional Authority

Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power "To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations" and "To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises." The tariff power is inherently legislative. Presidential authority to adjust tariffs derives entirely from explicit congressional delegation and carries the condition that such delegation must be exercised within the statutory purposes and procedures Congress established.

The Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) establishes congressional primacy over international trade. The Supreme Court has consistently held that delegations of trade authority must be interpreted in light of congressional intent. In J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394 (1928), the Court established that delegations of tariff authority must articulate an "intelligible principle" guiding executive action. The Trump administration's invocation of IEEPA for general-purpose tariff policy far exceeds any plausible intelligible principle within that statute's text and history.

The president retains inherent constitutional authority in foreign relations (Article II, Section 2) that informs trade negotiation and treaty implementation. However, this authority does not override explicit congressional trade statutes. The USMCA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. § 4501) represents a positive exercise of congressional trade authority; executive use of IEEPA to override its tariff obligations violated the Presentment Clause and separation of powers.

### Major Applicable Statutes

**Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq.)**: The foundational modern trade statute. Section 201 authorizes temporary safeguard tariffs following International Trade Commission injury investigations. Section 301 authorizes the USTR to investigate and respond to unfair foreign trade practices, with defined procedural requirements. Section 302 requires formal petitions, investigation timelines, and public comment. Trade Adjustment Assistance for workers is authorized under Subchapter II (19 U.S.C. § 2291 et seq.).

**Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. § 1862)**: Section 232 authorizes the president to impose tariffs or quotas on imports that the Department of Commerce finds threaten national security, following a formal investigation with specific procedural requirements. The statute was designed for genuine national security threats — not general trade policy instruments.

**International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq.)**: Authorizes the president to regulate economic transactions during a declared national emergency with respect to an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security, foreign policy, or the economy. The statute was designed for sanctions regimes targeting hostile foreign actors. Its application to impose peacetime tariffs on allied nations for non-trade purposes represents an abuse of emergency authority with no historical precedent.

**USMCA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. § 4501 et seq.)**: Implements the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, establishing tariff schedules, rules of origin, and dispute resolution mechanisms. The Act represents a positive congressional authorization of a specific tariff regime for North American trade.

**WTO Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. § 3511 et seq.)**: Implements U.S. obligations under the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). U.S. commitments include tariff bindings, national treatment obligations (GATT Article III), and dispute settlement participation.

**Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. § 1202)**: Provides the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. Sets the statutory ceiling for "column 2" rates applicable to non-normal trade relations partners.

**Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (19 U.S.C. § 4201 et seq.)**: Establishes Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures, requiring congressional consultation and vote on trade agreements. This statute makes explicit that major trade agreements require active congressional participation.

### Trade Policy and National Security Nexus

Trade policy and national security are inseparable. The United States has historically recognized this connection through targeted, legally grounded mechanisms: export controls to prevent sensitive technology from reaching adversaries, CFIUS investment screening to prevent foreign acquisition of critical U.S. assets, and sanctions regimes against designated hostile actors. These instruments operate under clear statutory authority, with defined purposes, oversight mechanisms, and judicial review.

The Trump administration's approach conflated legitimate national security trade tools with general-purpose economic coercion. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. § 1862) was designed to address genuine security threats — not to impose across-the-board steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and other allied nations whose steel and aluminum exports pose no conceivable security threat. The statute requires a Department of Commerce investigation finding that imports threaten to impair national security — a finding that has no credible basis when applied to imports from democratic allies bound by mutual defense treaties.

The Project 2029 administration will restore the proper relationship between trade and national security:

**Legitimate Security-Based Trade Restrictions**: Export controls under the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. § 4801 et seq.) will be applied rigorously to prevent advanced technologies — artificial intelligence chips, quantum computing hardware, advanced manufacturing equipment, and dual-use biological research tools — from reaching the Chinese military-industrial complex and other adversary actors. The Entity List will be maintained and expanded based on documented evidence of military end-use.

**Section 232 Reform**: The administration will direct the Department of Commerce to review all existing Section 232 orders for compliance with the statutory requirement of a genuine national security threat finding. Section 232 tariffs on allies — which have generated retaliatory tariffs harming U.S. exporters — will be replaced with negotiated quantitative agreements (as the Biden administration achieved with the EU and UK) where applicable. Future Section 232 actions will be reserved for genuine threats from adversarial sources.

**CFIUS Strengthening**: The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will receive additional resources to complete reviews within statutory timelines and expand its capacity to address Chinese acquisitions in critical technology, infrastructure, agricultural land, and data-sensitive sectors. The CFIUS process will be coordinated with allied nations implementing comparable investment screening through the G7 Trade Ministers framework.

**Allied Coordination on Economic Coercion**: The United States will establish a formal allied economic security coordination mechanism — building on the G7 Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion established in 2023 — to address Chinese economic coercion against allied nations through coordinated diplomatic, trade, and financial responses. No allied nation facing Chinese trade retaliation should face that coercion alone.

### International Legal Framework

**General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994**: Article I (Most Favored Nation) prohibits discriminatory tariff rates among WTO members without a formal waiver, Free Trade Agreement exemption under GATT Article XXIV, or Generalized System of Preferences authorization. Article II binds tariffs at negotiated rates. Article XIX permits safeguard measures following injury investigations. The Trump administration's blanket tariffs violated Article I and Article II without invoking any valid exception.

**Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU)**: Establishes the WTO's two-tier dispute settlement system: panel proceedings and Appellate Body review. The Appellate Body's functional collapse, caused by the U.S. veto of appointments, has been formally documented by the WTO as a systemic failure of the multilateral trading system.

**USMCA Chapter 10**: Establishes rules of origin for North American goods. USMCA Chapter 31: Dispute Resolution establishes binding state-to-state arbitration. USMCA Annex 2-B: Tariff elimination schedules. The 25 percent tariffs imposed under IEEPA contravened these provisions without invoking any USMCA-authorized exception.

---

## Part III: Comprehensive Trade Policy Restoration and Reform

### Reform I: Restore Rules-Based Tariff Policy and Terminate Unlawful IEEPA Tariffs

The first and most urgent action of the new administration is to terminate tariffs imposed through IEEPA that lack valid statutory justification under the procedural requirements of the Trade Act of 1974 or the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. IEEPA is a tool for genuine national emergencies — sanctions against hostile regimes, responses to foreign attacks on the U.S. financial system, or freezing assets of designated terrorist organizations. It is not a general-purpose tariff statute, and its use as one has corrupted the constitutional balance between Congress and the executive branch in trade matters.

The administration will issue an executive order within the first 30 days rescinding IEEPA-based tariff orders imposed for non-emergency trade policy purposes, restoring MFN tariff rates to levels consistent with U.S. WTO bound commitments and trade agreement obligations. Where tariffs on specific products or from specific countries are warranted on trade policy grounds, the administration will pursue them through proper statutory channels: Section 201 safeguard investigations through the International Trade Commission, Section 301 investigations through USTR, or Section 232 national security reviews through the Department of Commerce — each with mandatory procedural requirements, public comment periods, and defined findings.

This does not mean unconditional trade liberalization. Strategic tariffs imposed through proper procedures and justified by genuine findings — particularly with respect to Chinese state-subsidized industries engaged in dumping practices — will be maintained and enforced. The distinction between rules-based trade enforcement and lawless executive coercion is not a distinction between protectionism and free trade; it is the distinction between constitutional government and executive overreach.

The administration will work with Congress to enact the Trade Emergency Authority Reform Act, amending IEEPA to expressly prohibit its use for imposing peacetime tariffs on ordinary commercial imports, and establishing sunset provisions requiring congressional reauthorization for any IEEPA-based trade action exceeding 90 days.

### Reform II: Restore WTO Appellate Body Functionality

The United States will cease blocking WTO Appellate Body judicial appointments and engage constructively in the reform process that 130 WTO member nations have sought to initiate. The WTO Appellate Body's dysfunction has not served American interests. Without binding dispute settlement, U.S. exporters have no reliable mechanism to enforce WTO commitments against foreign governments that impose illegal subsidies, discriminatory standards, or market access restrictions.

The administration will direct the USTR to present a U.S. reform proposal for the Appellate Body that addresses legitimate concerns about judicial overreach — including issues of advisory opinions on matters beyond the specific dispute, the "zeroing" methodology controversy, and appellate timelines. The goal is a reformed Appellate Body that operates within its mandate while providing binding, enforceable rulings. This requires engagement, not obstruction.

The United States will engage with MPIA member nations to coordinate on WTO reform strategy, with the objective of developing a consolidated multilateral reform proposal by the end of Year 1 that has sufficient support for adoption at the WTO General Council. The United States will also introduce legislation — the WTO Dispute Settlement Restoration Act — directing USTR to develop and advance an Appellate Body reform proposal within 180 days and providing congressional authorization for any U.S. compromise agreement on dispute settlement reform.

### Reform III: Strategic China Trade Policy — Targeted Decoupling, Rules-Based Competition

The United States has legitimate and substantial national security and economic interests that require a strategic, differentiated approach to trade with China. The Project 2025 approach — blanket escalatory tariffs with no defined end state — achieved none of the stated goals, devastated American agricultural exporters, and provided no framework for managing competition in sectors that actually matter for national security.

The administration will implement a Strategic China Trade Policy organized around three distinct tracks:

**Track 1: Security-Critical Decoupling.** The administration will maintain and strengthen targeted restrictions on trade in goods and technologies that pose genuine national security threats: advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, advanced telecommunications infrastructure (5G, 6G), artificial intelligence chips and systems with military applications, quantum computing hardware, biotechnology with weapons applications, and critical rare earth elements and critical minerals processing. These restrictions will be implemented through the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. § 730 et seq.), the Entity List, and investment screening through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS, 50 U.S.C. § 4565), not through IEEPA blanket tariffs that sweep in consumer goods, agricultural products, and manufactured goods without security relevance.

**Track 2: Subsidized Industries and Unfair Trade Practices.** The administration will pursue aggressive enforcement against Chinese state-subsidized industries through proper WTO and domestic trade remedy channels — antidumping investigations under 19 U.S.C. § 1673, countervailing duty investigations under 19 U.S.C. § 1671, and Section 301 investigations under 19 U.S.C. § 2411. Where Chinese industrial policy produces genuinely trade-distorting effects on American producers, specific sector-targeted tariffs following ITC injury findings are appropriate and legally defensible.

**Track 3: Managed Competition and Bilateral Engagement.** For the broad category of ordinary commercial goods — consumer products, intermediate goods, and services — where China is a competitive but legitimate market participant, the United States will restore WTO-consistent tariff rates and pursue bilateral frameworks for managing competition, intellectual property enforcement, and market access on a reciprocal basis.

The administration will negotiate a new Bilateral Investment and Technology Agreement with China that establishes clear rules for technology transfer, intellectual property protection, and market access reciprocity — and establishes a bilateral dispute resolution mechanism with real enforcement consequences for violations.

### Reform IV: Repair USMCA and North American Trade Relationships

Canada and Mexico are the United States' two largest export markets. The North American trading relationship — $1.7 trillion in annual trilateral commerce, deeply integrated supply chains in automotive, agriculture, energy, and advanced manufacturing — is the foundation of American economic competitiveness. The Trump administration's use of IEEPA to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods for immigration and drug enforcement purposes was a strategic catastrophe that alienated democratic allies and established a precedent for trade-as-coercion that will haunt American credibility for a generation.

The administration will take immediate diplomatic action to restore the North American trade relationship. Within the first 30 days, the administration will rescind IEEPA orders applied to Canada and Mexico for non-trade purposes and issue a formal commitment — codified in a diplomatic exchange of notes — that the United States will not invoke emergency trade authorities against Canada or Mexico except in response to genuine trade emergencies as defined in the USMCA dispute resolution framework.

The administration will engage proactively in the USMCA six-year review process (due 2026) to strengthen the agreement's provisions on labor rights, environmental standards, digital trade, and currency manipulation. The administration will enforce existing USMCA labor chapter provisions (Chapter 23) through the Rapid Response Mechanism, which allows expedited action against violations of workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively at specific facilities. The administration will direct USTR to initiate at least five Rapid Response Mechanism cases in Year 1 to demonstrate that USMCA labor provisions have real enforcement teeth.

### Reform V: Trade Adjustment Assistance 2.0 — The Worker Social Compact

The political legitimacy of trade policy depends on the credibility of the social compact: workers who are displaced by trade will receive genuine support for retraining, income replacement, and re-employment. That compact was broken when TAA was allowed to lapse. This administration will not only restore TAA but transform it into a 21st-century worker support system commensurate with the scale of trade-driven economic disruption.

The administration will work with Congress to enact the American Worker Trade Transition Act, establishing:

**Enhanced Income Support**: Extend TAA income replacement benefits from the current 104 weeks to 156 weeks (three years) for workers over 50 and those in high-displacement sectors. Restore the wage insurance program (Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance) providing 50 percent of the wage differential for workers taking lower-paying jobs, with a ceiling increase from $10,000 to $25,000.

**Sector-Specific Workforce Development**: Establish dedicated funding streams for communities experiencing concentrated trade-related manufacturing displacement, including community college partnerships, registered apprenticeship expansion, and employer-led training consortia. Prioritize sectors — advanced manufacturing, clean energy, semiconductor production — where domestic supply chain development creates new employment pathways.

**Universal Trade Displacement Coverage**: Expand TAA eligibility beyond import-competition cases to cover workers displaced by production shifts to USMCA partners, service sector workers affected by offshoring, and workers in supplier firms affected by downstream import displacement. Current eligibility requirements exclude too many workers with genuine trade-related job losses.

**Proactive Adjustment Support**: Fund the Department of Labor to identify at-risk industries and communities before displacement occurs, providing advance training resources and community economic development planning. Reactive adjustment assistance — helping workers after they lose jobs — is less effective than proactive preparation.

### Reform VI: Generalized System of Preferences Renewal and Reform

The GSP program — expired since December 31, 2020 — must be renewed and reformed to serve contemporary U.S. strategic interests. Duty-free access for developing-country exports to the United States is not charity; it is strategic investment in the economic development and political orientation of nations that are critical to reducing dependence on Chinese supply chains and maintaining U.S. influence in the developing world.

The administration will work with Congress to enact the GSP Renewal and Reform Act, with the following provisions:

**Permanent Reauthorization**: Move from the historical pattern of repeated short-term renewals to a permanent authorization with periodic eligibility reviews, eliminating the import duty burden that falls on U.S. companies and consumers during lapse periods. Retroactively reimburse duties paid during the lapse period from January 1, 2021 to the date of enactment, consistent with past GSP retroactivity practice.

**Labor and Environmental Eligibility Standards**: Strengthen GSP eligibility requirements to include International Labour Organization core labor standards, including freedom of association, collective bargaining rights, and prohibitions on forced and child labor. Environmental standards consistent with multilateral agreements addressing climate and biodiversity.

**Supply Chain Diversification Preference**: Establish enhanced preference margins for developing countries producing goods in sectors where the United States is seeking to diversify away from Chinese supply chain concentration — electronics assembly components, pharmaceutical ingredients, critical mineral processing, and textile and apparel production. This converts GSP from a development tool into a strategic supply chain instrument.

**Graduation Reform**: Revise the automatic graduation thresholds — which remove competitive developing countries from GSP eligibility — to focus on product competitiveness rather than country income level, ensuring continued access for lower-income beneficiaries in sectors where they remain competitive.

### Reform VII: Labor Rights and Environmental Standards as Core Trade Provisions

Every future U.S. trade agreement will contain binding, enforceable labor rights and environmental standards, with dispute resolution procedures and trade sanction remedies equivalent to those available for commercial violations. The principle — established in USMCA's labor chapter and the Peru FTA labor provisions — that trade agreements can and must condition market access on compliance with core labor and environmental standards will be expanded and made universal.

The administration will direct USTR to pursue negotiations toward accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) — the successor to the Trans-Pacific Partnership — contingent on negotiating enhanced labor rights and environmental standards chapters that meet the levels established in USMCA. CPTPP membership would provide rules-based market access to 11 Asia-Pacific economies representing approximately 13 percent of global GDP.

For environmental standards, the administration will develop a U.S. approach to addressing carbon-intensive imports that is consistent with WTO Article XX(b) (measures necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health) and Article XX(g) (measures relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources). The administration will coordinate with the European Union — which implemented its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism beginning January 1, 2026 — to develop compatible approaches that avoid fragmentation of climate trade policy while presenting a unified framework to high-carbon producers.

### Reform VIII: Supply Chain Resilience for Critical Sectors

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the catastrophic vulnerability created by concentrated supply chains for pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, semiconductors, and critical minerals. The Trump administration's blanket tariffs created additional disruption without building domestic resilience. The Project 2029 approach replaces tariff-as-industrial-policy with targeted investments and allied coordination to build genuine supply chain security.

**Pharmaceuticals and Medical Supplies**: The administration will work with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense to map pharmaceutical supply chain dependencies, identify single-source vulnerabilities, and create procurement incentives — through the Defense Production Act (50 U.S.C. § 4501 et seq.) and Federal Acquisition Regulations — for domestic or allied-country production of essential generic drugs, medical devices, and active pharmaceutical ingredients.

**Semiconductors**: The administration will fully implement the CHIPS and Science Act (P.L. 117-167) semiconductor manufacturing incentives, ensure CHIPS funding is coordinated with allied semiconductor investment programs (particularly with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and the EU), and establish export control coordination through the Wassenaar Arrangement and the multilateral Export Control Cooperation initiative to prevent technology diversion to adversaries.

**Critical Minerals and Rare Earth Elements**: The administration will negotiate Critical Minerals Agreements with allied nations — Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, and South Korea — to develop supply chain alternatives to Chinese rare earth processing, which currently dominates 60-70 percent of global refined capacity. The administration will use the Defense Production Act to support domestic and allied mining, processing, and recycling capacity for lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and the 17 rare earth elements.

**Coordination Through the Minerals Security Partnership**: The administration will strengthen and expand the Minerals Security Partnership — a multilateral initiative covering 14 nations plus the EU — as the primary vehicle for allied critical mineral supply chain development, linking U.S. trade and development finance (through the DFC, the Export-Import Bank, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation) to strategic mineral projects in partner nations.

### Reform IX: USTR Institutional Restoration and Trade Governance Reform

The Office of the United States Trade Representative is the federal government's dedicated trade policy institution — a cabinet-level agency with statutory authority over trade negotiations, trade agreement enforcement, and unfair trade practice investigations. It is staffed by career trade professionals with expertise in international trade law, sectoral economics, and negotiating strategy. Project 2025's approach to USTR was to subordinate it to White House political control and reduce its institutional independence.

The administration will restore USTR's institutional integrity and expand its capacity to meet 21st-century trade challenges. Key governance reforms include:

**Statutory Clarification of USTR Authority**: Work with Congress to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to clarify that USTR has primary responsibility for trade agreement negotiations and that the use of emergency statutes (IEEPA, Section 232) for routine trade policy actions requires USTR review and concurrence with a formal finding of trade policy necessity.

**USTR Staffing and Budget Expansion**: USTR operates with approximately 250 professional staff — vastly insufficient for an agency responsible for trade relationships affecting $6 trillion annually. The administration will seek a 50 percent staffing increase, with dedicated expansion in offices covering labor rights enforcement, environmental standards, digital trade, supply chain security, and trade adjustment coordination.

**Annual Trade Policy Agenda Report**: Restore the USTR practice of submitting a comprehensive annual trade policy agenda and annual report to Congress, providing accountability for trade policy priorities and outcomes. The Trump administration's practice of treating trade negotiations as confidential presidential prerogatives — with congressional notification minimized — will be reversed.

**Interagency Coordination Strengthening**: The administration will reconstitute the Trade Policy Review Group and the Trade Policy Staff Committee as active interagency coordination mechanisms, ensuring that Commerce, Treasury, State, Defense, Agriculture, and Labor have meaningful input into trade policy formation without subordinating USTR's statutory leadership role.

**Congressional Trade Consultation**: The administration will restore robust consultation with congressional trade committees — Senate Finance and House Ways and Means — at all stages of trade negotiation, consistent with Trade Promotion Authority requirements. Congressional trade advisory groups (ITACs) will be fully staffed with diverse representation including labor, environmental, consumer, and small business voices alongside industry representation.

**Trade Enforcement Priorities**: The administration will publish annual trade enforcement priority lists identifying specific countries and practices subject to enforcement action under Section 301, antidumping and countervailing duty laws, and USMCA labor and environmental chapters. Enforcement decisions will be made on legal merits through proper procedures — not used as leverage for unrelated political objectives.

### Reform X: Rebuilding Trade Relationships with Democratic Allies

The Trump administration's tariff aggression against democratic allies — Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the United Kingdom — accomplished what no Chinese diplomat could have engineered: it drove democratic nations toward accelerated trade diversification away from the United States, accelerated EU-Canada, EU-Japan, and EU-Australia trade agreements, and created political conditions in allied nations that will make future cooperation more difficult for years. Rebuilding these relationships requires more than rescinding tariffs; it requires affirmative commitments and new institutional mechanisms for trade partnership.

**Trans-Atlantic Trade Framework.** The administration will initiate negotiations with the European Union on a Trans-Atlantic Trade and Technology Agreement, building on the Trade and Technology Council established in 2021. The framework will address market access barriers in digital services, financial services, and agricultural products; establish coordinated approaches to AI regulation and data governance; and develop compatible approaches to the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. A comprehensive U.S.-EU trade agreement has never been concluded despite the relationship representing the world's largest bilateral trade and investment relationship, approaching $1.7 trillion in annual goods and services trade.

**U.S.-UK Trade Agreement.** Following Brexit, the United Kingdom sought a bilateral trade agreement with the United States that the Trump administration converted into a venue for tariff threats. The Project 2029 administration will conclude a comprehensive U.S.-UK free trade agreement, covering goods, services, digital trade, financial services, and regulatory cooperation, with binding labor rights and environmental standards chapters consistent with USMCA precedent.

**Indo-Pacific Economic Framework Enhancement.** The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), launched by the Biden administration in 2022, established a multilateral structure for economic engagement with 14 Asia-Pacific partners representing 40 percent of global GDP. The administration will strengthen IPEF's market access and enforcement provisions and use it as the primary vehicle for deepening economic relationships with key Indo-Pacific democracies — India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines — as a strategic counterweight to Chinese economic influence in the region.

**Africa Trade Initiative.** The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA, 19 U.S.C. § 3721 et seq.) provides duty-free access for sub-Saharan African exports and expires in 2025. The administration will support permanent AGOA reauthorization with enhanced provisions, combined with increased U.S. development finance through the DFC to support African infrastructure, clean energy, and manufacturing investment. Africa represents the world's fastest-growing consumer market and a critical arena for strategic competition with Chinese economic influence.

### Reform XI: Digital Trade Framework

Digital trade — cross-border data flows, e-commerce, cloud services, digital financial services, and platform economy transactions — represents the fastest-growing component of international trade and remains substantially ungoverned by existing trade agreements. The WTO has operated under a 1998 moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions that must be made permanent and extended.

The administration will direct USTR to develop a comprehensive U.S. Digital Trade Framework and pursue its incorporation into existing and future trade agreements. The framework will address:

**Cross-Border Data Flows**: Establish provisions protecting cross-border data flows from data localization requirements that fragment the internet and disadvantage U.S. technology companies, while preserving the right of governments to require data protection standards consistent with privacy laws.

**Source Code and Algorithm Protection**: Prohibit trading partners from requiring disclosure of source code or algorithms as a condition of market access — a practice used by China and other nations to extract intellectual property.

**Digital Services and Customs Duties**: Make permanent the WTO moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions and pursue binding commitments in bilateral and regional agreements.

**Platform Economy and Intermediary Liability**: Develop trade agreement provisions that protect U.S. platform companies from discriminatory treatment by foreign governments while establishing baseline standards for platform responsibility.

**Financial Technology**: Negotiate market access commitments for fintech services, cross-border payment systems, and digital financial products in trade agreements with key financial centers.

## Conclusion: Trade Policy as an Instrument of Democratic Values

Trade policy is not a technical matter for specialists. It is a statement of national values — about what kind of economy the United States wants to have, what obligations it owes to workers displaced by economic change, what relationships it seeks with the community of democratic nations, and how it will compete with authoritarian rivals without becoming what it opposes.

The Project 2025 approach to trade — tariffs as coercion, allies as leverage targets, workers as acceptable casualties, the rules-based order as an obstacle to be circumvented — represents a fundamental rejection of the postwar American vision. That vision, however imperfectly realized, held that American prosperity and global stability were inseparable, that democratic nations had stronger foundations for durable economic partnership than transactions with autocracies, and that the rules constraining American power also constrained the power of every other nation — which meant, on balance, they served American interests.

The Project 2029 trade policy framework restores that vision while updating it for contemporary challenges. Rules-based trade is not naive idealism; it is strategic realism, recognizing that the United States benefits from predictable rules more than any other nation because American exporters compete in more global markets than any other country's producers. Targeting China for genuine security threats while preserving ordinary commercial engagement is not weakness; it is the kind of strategic differentiation that actual policy requires. Protecting workers displaced by economic change is not anti-trade sentiment; it is the precondition for sustaining democratic political support for an open economy.

The administration commits to a trade policy worthy of the democratic experiment it serves.
