# REFORM #13: PAPER BALLOT TRAIL MANDATE
## Every Vote Auditable. End Hackable Elections.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**Electronic voting without paper trails is insecure and unauditable:**

**Current vulnerabilities:**
- Touchscreen voting machines (DREs) with no paper record
- Cannot verify vote was recorded correctly
- Cannot recount if disputed
- Cannot audit for hacking
- "Black box" voting—trust the machine, can't verify

**By the numbers:**
- 12% of voters (16 million Americans) use paperless machines
- 8 states allow jurisdictions to use paperless voting
- Zero ability to audit or recount paperless votes
- Documented cases of vote flips, machine errors, missing votes

**Security risks:**
- Machines hackable (proven by security researchers)
- Russian interference 2016: targeted election systems
- No paper trail = cannot detect or prove hacking
- "Trust me" voting is not democracy

**Real incidents:**
- Georgia 2002-2019: Paperless machines, multiple glitches, no way to verify
- Pennsylvania 2019: Machines changed votes (caught because voters noticed)
- Countless close elections with no recount possible (no paper trail)

**Expert consensus:**
- CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency): Paper ballots essential
- Election security experts: Unanimous—paper trails mandatory
- Intelligence agencies: Paper ballots protect against foreign interference

**The result:**
- Elections vulnerable to hacking
- No way to audit or verify results
- Public confidence undermined
- Democracy at risk

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Paper Ballot Trail Mandate Act

**Federal Requirement:**

**All federal elections (President, Senate, House) must use:**

1. **Paper Ballots (Human-Readable)**
   - Voter-verified paper ballots
   - Human-readable (not just barcodes or QR codes)
   - Voter reviews ballot before casting
   - Paper ballot is official record

2. **Options for Generating Paper Ballots:**

   **Option A: Hand-Marked Paper Ballots**
   - Voter fills out ballot by hand (pen/pencil)
   - Fed into scanner that counts votes
   - Paper ballot saved in secure box
   - **Most secure, most trustworthy**

   **Option B: Ballot-Marking Devices (BMDs)**
   - Voter uses machine to make selections (accessible for disabilities)
   - Machine PRINTS human-readable paper ballot
   - Voter reviews printed ballot before casting
   - Paper ballot fed into scanner and saved
   - **Accessible option with paper trail**

   **Option C: Mail-In Paper Ballots**
   - Voter receives paper ballot by mail
   - Fills out by hand
   - Returns by mail or drop box
   - **Convenient and secure**

3. **Risk-Limiting Audits (Mandatory)**
   - Hand-count random sample of paper ballots after election
   - Compare to machine count
   - If discrepancy: expand audit
   - Statistical confidence election was counted correctly
   - **Proof that machines counted correctly**

4. **Recounts Use Paper Ballots**
   - If close election or dispute: recount paper ballots
   - Cannot rely on re-running machine count
   - Hand count is backup
   - **Paper = insurance policy**

5. **Ballot Security Requirements**
   - Paper ballots stored securely (tamper-evident seals)
   - Chain of custody documented
   - Ballots preserved for 22 months (federal law)
   - Random audits ensure integrity

**Ban Paperless Machines:**
- No direct-recording electronic (DRE) machines without paper trail
- Existing paperless machines must be replaced by 2026
- Federal funding provided for replacement
- No exceptions

**Accessibility Maintained:**
- Ballot-marking devices (BMDs) for voters with disabilities
- Audio ballots
- Touchscreen interfaces
- But MUST produce human-readable paper ballot
- Accessibility does NOT require paperless voting

## 💰 COST & FUNDING

**Replace Paperless Machines:** $1 billion (one-time)
- ~10,000 paperless machines in use
- $100,000 each for replacement (paper-based system)
- Federal grants to affected counties
- Some states already replacing (momentum)

**Implement Risk-Limiting Audits:** $200 million/year
- Train auditors
- Statistical software
- Additional staff for hand counts
- Scales with close elections (more audits when needed)

**Ballot Security Infrastructure:** $300 million (one-time)
- Secure storage facilities
- Tamper-evident seals and containers
- Chain of custody systems
- Surveillance and monitoring

**Annual Operating Costs:** $500 million/year

- Scanning equipment maintenance
- Audit costs
- Storage and security

**Total First-Year Cost:** $2 billion
**Annual Cost:** $700 million

**Revenue Source:** General appropriation + Election Assistance Commission grants

**Return on Investment:**

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

**Election Security:**
- Hackable paperless machines: 12% → 0%
- Auditable elections: 88% → 100%
- Provable election integrity: establishes baseline
- Foreign interference: cannot change votes (paper = tamper-evident)

**Public Confidence:**
- Trust in election accuracy: 50% → 80%+
- Belief that votes counted correctly: 60% → 90%
- Acceptance of results: increases dramatically
- Conspiracy theories: harder to sustain (paper proves results)

**Recount Capability:**
- Elections without recount ability: 12% → 0%
- Close elections: can always recount
- Disputed results: can always verify
- Democracy: protected from errors and hacking

**Accessibility:**
- Voters with disabilities: still accommodated (BMDs produce paper)
- Visual impairments: audio ballots available
- Motor impairments: touchscreen assistance available
- No tradeoff between accessibility and security

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Aren't electronic machines more modern and efficient?"**
→ "Modern" doesn't mean "secure." Paper ballots with electronic SCANNERS are both modern AND secure—machines count fast, paper provides proof. Paperless machines are like banks with no receipts—efficient until something goes wrong, then you're screwed. Paper = insurance.

**"Can't we just improve cybersecurity on paperless machines?"**
→ NO. Security experts universally say: Nothing connected to humans can be 100% secure. Paper ballots CANNOT be hacked remotely—you'd need physical access to millions of paper ballots. Machines can be hacked in minutes. Why gamble democracy on cybersecurity when paper is unhackable?

**"Don't paper ballots slow things down?"**
→ Barely. Optical scanners count paper ballots almost as fast as paperless machines. Results might be delayed by 1-2 hours on election night. WORTH IT for secure elections. Plus, mail-in paper ballots (counted before Election Day) speed things up.

**"What about recounts—don't paper ballots make them harder?"**
→ OPPOSITE. Paperless machines CAN'T be recounted (no paper trail). You'd just re-run the same potentially hacked machine. Paper ballots can ALWAYS be recounted—hand count is always available. That's the point.

**"What about accessibility for disabled voters?"**
→ Ballot-marking devices (BMDs) provide full accessibility—audio, touchscreen, etc.—AND produce paper ballots. You can have both accessibility and security. No tradeoff required. Plus, nearly all voters can use hand-marked paper ballots.

## 🔥 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Paperless voting machines = "trust me" voting.**

You vote. Machine records it. No proof. No verification. No audit. No recount.

**If hacked:** You'd never know.

**If error:** You'd never know.

**If disputed:** No way to verify.

**That's not democracy—that's faith in machines.**

**Paper ballots = provable democracy:**

✅ **Voter-verified** (you see your choices printed)
✅ **Human-readable** (not just barcodes—actual words)
✅ **Auditable** (random hand counts prove accuracy)
✅ **Recountable** (always have paper to recount)
✅ **Unhackable remotely** (need physical access to millions of ballots)
✅ **Expert consensus** (every security expert agrees)

**The math is simple:**
- Paper ballots + scanners = fast + secure + auditable
- Paperless machines = fast + insecure + unauditable

**Democracy is worth waiting an extra hour on election night.**

**Paper ballots. Audit every time. Democracy protected.** 🇺🇸
