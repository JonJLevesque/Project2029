# REFORM #10: AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION
## Everyone Registered. Opt-Out, Not Opt-In. Voting Made Easy.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**Voter registration is an unnecessary barrier to voting:**

**Current system:**
- Citizens must proactively register (opt-in)
- Deadlines 15-30 days before elections (miss it = can't vote)
- Paperwork requirements (varies by state)
- Re-registration required after moving
- Registration purges (aggressive, often wrong)
- Disproportionately affects: young people, poor people, people of color, frequent movers

**By the numbers:**
- 50 million eligible Americans NOT registered
- 20% of eligible citizens unregistered
- Young people (18-24): 30%+ unregistered
- People who moved recently: 40%+ unregistered
- Registration barriers turn away millions of voters

**Real-world impact:**
- 2016: Millions purged from rolls in key states (many wrongly)
- 2018: Georgia purged 1.4M voters (many eligible, couldn't vote)
- Every election: Voters show up, discover they're not registered, can't vote
- "I forgot to register" = common reason for not voting

**The result:**
- Voter turnout suppressed (60% vs. 80%+ in countries with automatic registration)
- Democracy less representative
- Vulnerable populations disenfranchised

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) Act

**Automatic Registration:**

**When you interact with government, you're automatically registered to vote:**

1. **DMV (Driver's License/State ID):**
   - Get or renew license → automatically registered
   - Update address → registration updated automatically
   - Opt-out option (if you don't want to register)
   - **This alone registers 90%+ of eligible citizens**

2. **Federal Agencies:**
   - Social Security Administration
   - Veterans Affairs
   - Medicaid/Medicare enrollment
   - Federal student aid (FAFSA)
   - Passport applications
   - Interaction with any federal agency → registered

3. **State/Local Agencies:**
   - Public universities (enrollment = registration)
   - Public assistance programs
   - State healthcare programs
   - Marriage licenses
   - Any government service = registration opportunity

4. **High Schools:**
   - Seniors automatically pre-registered (activated on 18th birthday)
   - Civic education + registration combined
   - **Capture young voters early**

**How It Works:**

**Opt-Out System (Not Opt-In):**
- Government agency collects your info (already has it)
- Sends info to election officials
- You're registered automatically
- If you don't want to be registered: opt out (simple checkbox)
- **Default = registered** (flip of current system)

**Continuous Updates:**
- Move → update driver's license → voter registration updates automatically
- No need to re-register
- No purges (registration follows you)
- Always registered at current address

**Security:**
- Citizenship verification (agencies already verify)
- No duplicate registrations (databases cross-checked)
- Fraud prevention (same as current, but more secure)

**Same-Day Registration Backup:**
- If somehow not registered: register at polls on Election Day
- Backup ensures no eligible voter turned away
- Provisional ballot while registration verified

## 🎯 HOW YOU CAN HELP

### Individual Actions
1. **Contact representatives** - demand support for AVR Act
2. **Vote** for candidates supporting automatic registration
3. **Share this one-pager** - educate others
4. **If your state has AVR:** celebrate and defend it
5. **If not:** pressure state legislature for state-level AVR

### Organizational Actions
1. **Endorse AVR Act**
2. **Support state-level AVR** (21 states + DC already have it)
3. **Voter registration drives** (until AVR passes, still needed)
4. **Coalition building** (voting rights groups)
5. **Public education** on AVR benefits

### Political Actions
1. **State ballot initiatives** (if your state allows)
2. **Make it litmus test** - support AVR or lose vote
3. **Primary challenge** opponents
4. **State-by-state campaigns** (federal + state levels)
5. **Court challenges** to registration barriers (where AVR blocked)

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Why should people be automatically registered if they don't want to vote?"**
→ They can opt OUT. It's easier to check a box saying "don't register me" than to navigate complex registration. Plus, being registered doesn't force anyone to vote—it just removes barriers for those who want to. Democracy works better when participation is easy, not hard.

**"Won't this lead to fraud?"**
→ NO. Fraud is already incredibly rare (0.0003% of votes). AVR uses same citizenship verification as current registration (DMV, agencies already verify). Actually MORE secure—fewer errors, better databases, cross-checking. 21 states already use AVR with no fraud increases.

**"Isn't this a federal overreach into state elections?"**
→ Federal elections (President, Congress) are federal concern. Constitution gives Congress authority to regulate (Article I, Section 4). Plus, federal government provides funding and support—states still administer. Same as Voting Rights Act, Motor Voter Act, Help America Vote Act. Established precedent.

**"Will this favor Democrats?"**
→ **Democracy should be nonpartisan.** If one party benefits from making voting easier and the other benefits from making it harder, that tells you everything. Every eligible citizen should be registered—period. If your party can't win when everyone participates, adapt your platform, don't suppress votes.

**"What about people who move a lot?"**
→ That's EXACTLY who AVR helps most! Update your driver's license → voter registration updates automatically. No re-registering. No purges. Registration follows you. Currently, frequent movers (young people, renters, military) are disproportionately disenfranchised. AVR fixes this.
