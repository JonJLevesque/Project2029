# REFORM #4: BAN GERRYMANDERING
## Independent Commissions Draw Fair Maps. End Partisan Rigging.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**Gerrymandering = Politicians choosing their voters instead of voters choosing their politicians.**

**What gerrymandering does:**
- Locks in partisan advantage regardless of vote totals
- Creates "safe" districts where incumbents can't lose
- Dilutes minority voting power (racial gerrymandering)
- Produces extreme candidates (no need to appeal to moderates)
- Makes voters' preferences irrelevant

**By the numbers:**
- 2012: Democrats win 1.4M more House votes, Republicans win 33 more seats
- 2016: Wisconsin Republicans win 64% of Assembly seats with 48% of vote
- 2018: North Carolina Republicans win 10 of 13 seats with 50% of vote
- 40-50 House seats effectively predetermined by gerrymandering
- Impacts state legislatures even more than Congress

**Real-world examples:**
- Maryland's 3rd District: Nicknamed "praying mantis" for absurd shape
- North Carolina's 12th District: 100+ miles long, follows I-85 highway
- Illinois's 4th District: "Earmuff" shape connecting two Hispanic neighborhoods
- Pennsylvania's 7th District (pre-2018): Looked like "Goofy kicking Donald Duck"

**The result:**
- Voters feel powerless (why vote if outcome predetermined?)
- Extremism rewarded (safe districts = no need for moderation)
- Democracy undermined (system is rigged)

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Federal Mandate: Independent Redistricting Commissions

**The John Lewis Voting Rights Act (Enhanced) includes:**

**Section 1: Federal Standards for Redistricting**

All states must use **independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions** with:

**Composition:**
- 15 commissioners: 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, 5 independents
- Selected by panel of retired federal judges (not politicians)
- Cannot be current or recent elected officials, party officials, or lobbyists
- Must include minority representation proportional to state demographics

**Criteria (in priority order):**
1. **Equal population** (one person, one vote)
2. **Voting Rights Act compliance** (no dilution of minority voting power)
3. **Compactness** (no absurd shapes)
4. **Contiguity** (districts must be connected)
5. **Preserve communities of interest** (keep neighborhoods together)
6. **Competitive when possible** (no packing/cracking for partisan advantage)
7. **PROHIBITED:** Using partisan data or election results to favor party

**Transparency:**
- All meetings public and livestreamed
- Proposed maps published 60 days before adoption
- Public comment period required
- Final maps subject to judicial review (federal court)

**Enforcement:**
- DOJ can sue to block illegal maps
- Federal court can impose maps if state fails to comply
- Criminal penalties for commissioners who violate partisan ban

### Existing Models That Work

**California (since 2010):**
- Citizens Redistricting Commission
- Result: More competitive districts, less extremism
- Both parties initially opposed, both now accept legitimacy

**Arizona (since 2000):**
- Independent Redistricting Commission
- Survived legal challenges (*Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona IRC*, 2015)
- Produced fairer maps than legislature ever did

**Michigan (since 2018):**
- Citizens approved independent commission by ballot initiative (61%)
- Blocked gerrymandering that gave Republicans 58% of seats with 47% of vote

### Constitutional Amendment (If Needed)

**33rd Amendment (Backup if courts hostile):**
```
Section 1: Each state shall establish an independent, nonpartisan commission
to draw congressional and state legislative districts.

Section 2: No current or recent elected official, party official, or lobbyist
may serve as commissioner.

Section 3: Districts shall be compact, contiguous, respect communities of
interest, and shall NOT be drawn to favor political party or incumbent.

Section 4: Congress has power to enforce by appropriate legislation.
```

## 💰 COST & FUNDING

**Legislative Cost (Federal Mandate):** $0 to federal government

**State Implementation Costs:** $250 million total (one-time)
- 50 states × $5M average = $250M
- Federal grants to support state commissions
- Technology for mapping software
- Commissioner compensation
- Public transparency infrastructure

**Annual Operating Costs:** $100 million
- 50 states × $2M average = $100M/year
- Commissioner salaries
- Staff support
- Public engagement
- Only costs money every 10 years (redistricting after census)

**Amendment Cost (if needed):** $75 million ratification campaign over 7 years

**Revenue Source:** General appropriation (tiny fraction of federal budget)

**Return on Investment:**
- Fairer representation = better policy outcomes = immeasurable value
- Reduced extremism = more functional government
- Restored faith in democracy = priceless

3. **Support John Lewis Voting Rights Act** - federal mandate
4. **Litigation** - challenge illegal maps in court
5. **Vote out gerrymanderers** - make them pay politically

### Everyone
1. **Contact your representatives** - demand support for federal mandate
2. **Educate others** - most don't understand gerrymandering
3. **Share this one-pager** widely
4. **Join reform organizations** (Common Cause, Fair Districts, etc.)

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Both parties gerrymander—why should we care?"**
→ EXACTLY why we need independent commissions! When both sides cheat, voters lose. Independent process removes incentive and ability to cheat. Democracy shouldn't depend on which party controls redistricting in which year.

**"Won't independent commissions still be biased?"**
→ Not if properly designed. Mix of parties + independents + transparent process + judicial review = far fairer than legislature drawing own districts. California, Arizona, Michigan prove it works. Perfect? No. Better than current system? Absolutely.

**"This is a state issue—federal government shouldn't interfere!"**
→ Federal Constitution guarantees equal protection and voting rights. Gerrymandering violates both. Congress has constitutional authority to regulate federal elections (Article I, Section 4). Plus, gerrymandered House delegations affect entire country, not just individual states.

**"Gerrymandering has always existed!"**
→ And slavery once existed. Democracy evolves. Technology made gerrymandering FAR more effective and precise than ever before. We can now surgically carve districts block-by-block to lock in outcomes. That's not traditional politics—that's rigging the game.

**"Independent commissions might help Democrats/Republicans!"**
→ **Fair maps help VOTERS.** If one party currently benefits from gerrymandering in a state, yes, independent commissions will hurt that party there. But democracy isn't about protecting parties—it's about representing people fairly.

## 🔥 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Gerrymandering is legalized rigging of elections.**

Politicians drawing their own district lines is like students grading their own exams. **Obvious conflict of interest.**

**Independent commissions fix this:**
- Nonpartisan experts, not politicians
- Transparent process, not backroom deals
- Fair maps, not absurd shapes
- Voters choose representatives, not vice versa

**After 2030 census, every state should use independent commissions.**

Federal law can mandate this. Courts have upheld it. Public supports it (70%+).

**The only people who oppose fair maps are the ones currently benefiting from rigged maps.**

**End gerrymandering. Restore democracy. Simple.** 🇺🇸
