# REFORM #7: PUBLICLY FUNDED ELECTIONS
## Democracy Vouchers + Matching Funds. Level the Playing Field.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**Current campaign finance system = legalized bribery:**
- Candidates spend 30-70% of time fundraising (not legislating)
- 0.01% of Americans provide 40%+ of campaign funds
- Wealthy donors get access and influence; average citizens ignored
- Politicians beholden to donors, not voters
- Small donors can't compete with super PACs

**By the numbers:**
- 2020 elections: $14.4 billion spent
- Average winning Senate campaign: $15-30 million
- Average winning House campaign: $2-5 million
- Time members of Congress spend fundraising: 4-6 hours/day
- Influence of mega-donors vs. constituents: mega-donors win every time

**The result:**
- Candidates who can't raise money from wealthy donors can't run
- Working-class Americans effectively barred from office
- Policies favor donors over voters
- Democracy becomes plutocracy

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Democracy Funding Act

**Two-Part System:**

**Part 1: Democracy Vouchers (Inspired by Seattle Model)**

**How It Works:**
- Every registered voter receives $100 in "democracy vouchers" annually
- Vouchers can be given to candidates of voter's choice
- Candidates must qualify and opt into system
- Vouchers funded by federal treasury (all taxpayers)

**Qualification Requirements:**
- Candidate must collect signatures (proof of serious candidacy)
- Agree to spending limits and disclosure requirements
- Agree to participate in debates
- Cannot accept corporate/super PAC money

**The Math:**
- 160 million registered voters × $100 = $16 billion/year
- **More than current campaign spending ($14.4B in 2020)**
- Every voter has equal voice
- Small donors empowered like never before

**Impact:**
- Working-class candidates can run (don't need wealthy networks)
- Politicians spend time talking to voters, not donors
- Policy reflects voters' preferences, not donors' preferences
- Democratic equality: every citizen has same $100 to give

**Part 2: Small Dollar Matching Funds (6:1 Ratio)**

**How It Works:**
- Small donations (<$200) matched 6:1 by federal treasury
- $10 donation becomes $70 to candidate
- $200 donation becomes $1,400 to candidate
- Only small donations matched (no matching for rich donors)

**Qualification Requirements:**
- Candidate must demonstrate grassroots support (threshold # of donors)
- Opt into spending limits
- Agree to debates and disclosure
- Cannot accept corporate/super PAC money

**The Math:**
- Amplifies small donors 7× (their $10 = rich person's $70)
- Makes small-dollar fundraising competitive with big-dollar
- Estimated cost: $3-5 billion/year

**Impact:**
- Small donors become powerful constituency
- Candidates seek many small donations vs. few large ones
- Grassroots candidates can compete with establishment
- Democratic participation: millions more people donate

**Part 3: Total Spending Limits (For Participating Candidates)**

**House Races:**
- $1 million limit (including vouchers + matched funds + unmatched donations)
- Enough to run competitive race
- Low enough to prevent arms race

**Senate Races:**
- $5-20 million limit (varies by state population)
- Scaled to state size
- Sufficient for statewide campaign

**Presidential Primary:**
- $300 million limit (total for primary season)
- Prevents billionaires buying nominations

**Presidential General Election:**
- $500 million limit per candidate
- Plus party spending (coordinated)
- Down from $1-2 billion currently spent

**Candidates who opt OUT:**
- Can raise/spend unlimited amounts (current system)
- But lose democracy vouchers, matching funds, and must disclose everything
- Face opponent empowered by millions of small donors
- Politically risky (voters prefer publicly funded candidates)

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Why should my taxes pay for campaigns?"**
→ You ALREADY pay for corruption. Corporations donate to candidates, get favorable laws, then raise prices and cut wages. That costs you thousands per year. $100/year for democracy vouchers is a bargain. Plus, YOU control your vouchers—give them to candidates YOU support.

**"Won't this cost too much?"**
→ $20B/year is 0.3% of federal budget. Less than 2 weeks in Afghanistan. Less than corporate subsidies. And corruption costs hundreds of billions/year. Public funding SAVES money by reducing corruption.

**"Rich people can still spend their own money!"**
→ Yes, but democracy vouchers + matching funds empowers millions of small donors to compete. $16B in vouchers + $3-5B in matching = $20-25B for candidates who opt in. That's MORE than rich donors can spend. Numbers beat money.

**"Won't bad candidates get funded?"**
→ Only if voters GIVE them vouchers. Unlike current system where rich weirdos fund crazy candidates, democracy vouchers mean candidates need broad support. That's a FEATURE—candidates must appeal to actual voters.

**"Is this constitutional after Citizens United?"**
→ YES. Citizens United said government can't RESTRICT spending. Public financing ADDS options—it doesn't restrict anyone. Rich people can still spend (we just empower everyone else to compete). Perfectly constitutional.
