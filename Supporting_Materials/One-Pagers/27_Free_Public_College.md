# ONE-PAGER #27: FREE PUBLIC COLLEGE
## Making Higher Education Accessible to All

**[See Chapter 11 for Complete Details]**

---

## THE PROBLEM

**Higher education has become unaffordable for most Americans.**

### The Numbers:

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Total student debt | **$1.77 trillion** |
| Number of borrowers | **44 million** |
| Average debt (4-year public) | **$30,000+** |
| Average debt (4-year private) | **$55,000+** |
| Borrowers over 60 | **3.5 million** |

### Tuition Has Exploded

**Tuition Increase Since 1980:** **1,200%**

| Year | Average Public University Tuition |
|------|----------------------------------|
| 1980 | $2,100 (inflation-adjusted) |
| 2000 | $5,400 |
| 2023 | **$11,260** |

**For comparison:**
- Inflation since 1980: 265%
- Healthcare increase: 600%
- **Tuition increase: 1,200%**

### Why It Happened

**State Disinvestment:**
- States cut higher education funding by **40%** per student since 2000
- Public universities shifted costs to students
- Result: Tuition replaced taxpayer support

**Federal Policy Failure:**
- Pell Grants covered 80% of public tuition in 1980
- Pell Grants now cover only **30%** of public tuition
- Federal policy focused on loans, not affordability

### The Consequences

**Who Suffers:**
- **Low-income students:** Priced out entirely
- **Middle-class families:** Drowning in debt
- **Communities of color:** Disproportionate debt burden
- **First-generation students:** Fear of debt prevents enrollment

**Broader Economic Harm:**
- Delayed homeownership (average delay: 7 years)
- Delayed family formation
- Entrepreneurship suppressed (can't take risks with debt)
- Economic inequality entrenched

## THE SOLUTION: FREE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION

### The Proposal

**Tuition-Free Public College and University for Families Under $125,000**

| Family Income | Benefit |
|---------------|---------|
| Under $60,000 | **Free tuition + fees + living expenses** |
| $60,000 - $125,000 | **Free tuition + fees** |
| $125,000 - $200,000 | Subsidized tuition (50-75%) |
| Over $200,000 | Full tuition (with need-based aid available) |

### How It Works: Federal-State Partnership

**Cost Sharing:**
- **Federal government:** 2/3 of costs
- **States:** 1/3 of costs

**Conditions for State Participation:**
- Maintain current per-student funding
- No tuition increases beyond inflation
- Meet completion and equity targets
- Serve all eligible residents

**Estimated Annual Cost:**
- **Federal share:** $80 billion
- **State share:** $40 billion
- **Total:** $120 billion

### What's Covered

| Coverage | Included |
|----------|----------|
| Tuition | ✅ Yes |
| Fees | ✅ Yes |
| Living expenses (under $60K) | ✅ Yes |
| Community colleges | ✅ Yes |
| 4-year public universities | ✅ Yes |
| Trade/vocational programs | ✅ Yes |
| Graduate school | Subsidized (varies) |

### Additional Reforms

**Pell Grant Doubling:**
- Current maximum: $7,395
- New maximum: **$14,000**
- Covers living expenses, books, supplies

**For-Profit College Crackdown:**
- Restore gainful employment rule
- 90/10 rule enforcement (85/15)
- Ban from federal aid for worst actors

## THE INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE

### Countries with Free or Nearly-Free Higher Education:

| Country | Tuition Cost | Result |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Germany | Free | 50% college attainment |
| Norway | Free | 50% college attainment |
| Sweden | Free | 45% college attainment |
| Denmark | Free | 49% college attainment |
| Finland | Free | 45% college attainment |
| **United States** | **$11,260+** | **33% college attainment** |

### Why America Can Do This

**We used to:**
- City University of New York: **Free until 1976**
- University of California: **Free until 1960s**
- GI Bill: **Free college for veterans** (8 million attended)

**We already spend $200+ billion on higher education:**
- Student loans
- Pell Grants
- Tax credits
- State funding

**We're just spending it poorly.**

## COMPLEMENTARY REFORMS

| All federal borrowers | $10,000 |
| Pell Grant recipients | $30,000 total |
| In IBR 20+ years | 100% |
| Income under $50K | $50,000 |
| Public service (10 years) | 100% |

**One-time cost:** $300-500 billion

### Teacher Loan Forgiveness

## BY THE NUMBERS

### Investment

| Program | Annual Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Free Public College (federal share) | $80 billion |
| Pell Grant Doubling | $20 billion |
| Student Debt Cancellation (amortized) | $30-50 billion |
| IBR improvements | $10 billion |
| **Total Annual** | **~$140-160 billion** |

### Context

**Current spending we could redirect:**
- Mortgage interest deduction (wealthy homeowners): $30 billion
- Capital gains exclusion on home sales: $40 billion
- Private school tax benefits: $2 billion
- Employer education benefits: $1 billion

**Revenue from billionaire tax:** $25-40 billion annually

**Revenue from wealth tax:** $300 billion annually

**Free public college is easily affordable.**

### Return on Investment

- **$1 invested in education = $7-10 in economic return**
- Higher earnings → Higher tax revenue
- Lower social costs (healthcare, incarceration)
- Innovation and productivity gains
- Reduced inequality

## LEGAL BASIS

**Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8):**
- Congress can condition funds on state requirements
- Federal-state partnerships well-established
- *South Dakota v. Dole* (1987): Upholds conditional funding

**Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.):**
- Federal framework for higher education aid
- Pell Grants, student loans, institutional aid
- Authority to set eligibility conditions

**Day 1 Executive Actions:**

1. **Student Loan Forbearance Extension** (6-12 months)
2. **PSLF Waiver Extension** (expanded eligibility)
3. **Borrower Defense Reinstatement** (for defrauded students)
4. **Gainful Employment Restoration** (for-profit accountability)
5. **IDR Administrative Improvements** (automatic enrollment)

## Q&A

**Q: Why should taxpayers pay for other people's college?**

A: We already do—just inefficiently. We pay for K-12 education because an educated population benefits everyone. Higher education is the new high school diploma. The question is whether we fund it through taxes (affordable) or debt (crushing).

**Q: Won't this benefit rich kids who could pay?**

A: The plan is income-targeted. Families over $125K still pay (with subsidies up to $200K). And universal programs build political durability—Social Security and Medicare are untouchable because everyone uses them.

**Q: Can't people just work their way through college?**

A: In 1980, you could work a minimum wage summer job and pay for a year of public college. Today, you'd need to work 2,000+ hours (full-time for a year) to cover tuition alone. The math no longer works.

**Q: Won't this make college "worth less"?**

A: No. Germany has free college and strong labor market outcomes. College provides skills, knowledge, and credentials—those don't diminish because more people have access. The economy needs more educated workers, not fewer.

**Q: What about private colleges?**

A: They can continue operating. Many will remain competitive through specialized programs, prestige, and resources. Free public college provides a floor, not a ceiling.

**Q: Why not just give loans?**

A: Because debt-financed education doesn't work. We've tried it for 40 years. Result: $1.77 trillion in debt, declining college affordability, and 44 million people in financial distress. It's time to try what works in every other developed country.

## TALKING POINTS

**"College is a choice—pay for your own choices."**
> K-12 is also a "choice"—we fund it publicly because education benefits society. Higher education is now required for most middle-class jobs. Treating it as purely personal consumption ignores economic reality.

**"I paid off my loans—why should others get forgiveness?"**
> Should we have kept polio because past generations suffered from it? Progress means future generations shouldn't face the same burdens. And past borrowers were hurt by the same predatory system.

**"Trade schools are better than college."**
> This plan covers trade and vocational programs too! It's about affordable post-secondary education, including skilled trades. The false choice between college and trades is a distraction.

**"This will just raise tuition."**
> The plan requires states to freeze tuition as a condition of participation. No tuition increases beyond inflation, or lose federal funding. Price controls are built in.

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Every other developed nation provides free or nearly-free higher education. America used to as well. We can do it again with $80 billion annually—less than we spend on tax breaks for the wealthy.**

**Free public college isn't radical. It's common sense. It's what every competitor nation does. And it's the key to rebuilding the middle class.**

**Education is a public good, not a private debt.**
