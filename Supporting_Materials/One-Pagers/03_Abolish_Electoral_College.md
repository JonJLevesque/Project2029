# REFORM #3: ABOLISH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
## One Person, One Vote. Land Doesn't Vote.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**The Electoral College is an antidemocratic relic that:**
- Makes votes unequal (Wyoming voter = 3.6x California voter)
- Allows popular vote losers to become president (2000, 2016)
- Concentrates campaigns in 6-8 swing states (ignores 80%+ of America)
- Suppresses turnout in "safe" states (why vote if outcome predetermined?)
- Creates constitutional crises (2020 fake elector scheme)
- **Has roots in slavery** (3/5ths compromise)

**The Electoral College has outlived any legitimate purpose. It must go.**

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### 32nd Amendment (Direct Popular Vote)

**Text:**
```
Section 1: President and Vice President elected by direct popular vote.
The person with greatest number of votes wins, provided they receive
a majority of total votes cast.

Section 2: If no person receives majority, runoff election between
top two within 60 days.

Section 3: Congress shall establish uniform national election standards.

Section 4: Takes effect for elections after December 31 following ratification.
```

### Interim Solution: National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC)

**While amendment proceeds:**

**How NPVIC Works:**
- States agree to award electoral votes to national popular vote winner
- Takes effect when states totaling 270+ electoral votes join
- **Current status: 209 electoral votes committed (17 states + DC)**
- **Need: 61 more electoral votes**

**Federal Strategy:**
- Presidential endorsement and advocacy
- DOJ legal defense if challenged
- Target states: Minnesota (10), Virginia (13), Nevada (6), Pennsylvania (19)
- **Goal: Achieve by 2028 election**

---

## 💰 COST & FUNDING

**Amendment Cost:** $0 (constitutional process)

**NPVIC Cost:** $10 million
- State organizing campaigns
- Legal defense fund
- Public education

**Implementation:** $50 million
- Uniform national election standards
- Federal Election Assistance Administration
- Coordination infrastructure

**Revenue:** None needed

## 📅 TIMELINE

**Year 1-2:** NPVIC Completion
- Target holdout blue/purple states
- 61 more electoral votes needed
- Presidential advocacy critical

**Years 1-5:** Build Amendment Coalition
- Grassroots state-by-state organizing
- Public education on EC's antidemocratic nature
- Coalition building (cross-partisan support)

**Years 5-12:** State Ratifications
- Need 38 of 50 states
- Typically 7-12 years for controversial amendments
- NPVIC provides momentum (proves concept works)

**Year 13+:** Direct Popular Vote in Effect
- Every vote counts equally nationwide
- Presidential campaigns visit all 50 states
- Increased turnout everywhere

---

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

**Electoral Equality:**
- Every vote counts equally (1 person = 1 vote)
- No more "swing state" vs "safe state" divide
- Candidates campaign nationally, not regionally

**Increased Turnout:**
- 10-15% turnout increase in currently "safe" states
- Young people vote more (their votes matter)
- Overall turnout: 75%+ (from 60%)

**Campaign Changes:**
- Visit all 50 states (not just 8)
- Appeal to all Americans (not just swing state voters)
- Rural votes count as much as urban (unlike current system)

**Constitutional Integrity:**
- No more fake elector schemes
- No more contested Electoral College certifications
- Clear winner on election night

1. **Contact state legislators** - urge NPVIC adoption
2. **Organize locally** - build NPVIC support
3. **Educate neighbors** - share this one-pager

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Small states will lose influence!"**
→ They already have ZERO influence as "safe" states. Under direct vote, campaigns would visit small states currently ignored. Plus, small states have equal Senate representation—that's their protection.

**"Urban areas will dominate!"**
→ PEOPLE will dominate, as they should in a democracy. 80% of Americans live in urban/suburban areas—that's where candidates SHOULD campaign. Rural votes count equally under direct vote (unlike current EC distortion).

**"The Founders intended the Electoral College!"**
→ Founders also intended slavery and only white male landowners voting. Constitution has been amended 27 times to perfect the Union. Democracy evolves.

**"It protects against tyranny of the majority!"**
→ EC doesn't protect against tyranny—it creates tyranny of the MINORITY. Twice in 20 years, popular vote losers became president (Bush 2000, Trump 2016). That's tyranny of MINORITY, not protection of it.

## 🔥 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Land doesn't fucking vote. People do.**

The Electoral College makes some Americans' votes worth more than others. That's the OPPOSITE of democracy.

**In 2020:**
- Biden won by 7+ million votes
- But came within 44,000 votes (3 states) of losing Electoral College
- If 22,000 people in right states voted differently, Trump wins despite losing by 7 million

**That's insane.**

**Direct popular vote is simple:** Whoever gets the most votes wins. Period.

**No more swing state lottery. No more fake electors. No more 3am math.**

**One person, one vote, full stop.** 🇺🇸
