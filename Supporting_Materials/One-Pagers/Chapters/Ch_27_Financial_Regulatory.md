# Chapter 27: Financial Regulatory Agencies — One-Pager

## What This Chapter Covers
The independent financial regulatory agencies -- the CFPB, SEC, CFTC, FDIC, OCC, NCUA, FHFA, and PCAOB -- collectively safeguard the financial system that undergirds the entire American economy. They protect ordinary Americans from predatory lenders, fraudulent securities schemes, and the systemic risks that crashed the economy in 2008. This chapter addresses Project 2025's systematic dismantling of consumer financial protections and proposes comprehensive restoration and reform.

## What Project 2025 Did / The Current Crisis
- **Gutted the CFPB:** The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was defunded, its director fired, and its enforcement actions halted, leaving 170 million American consumers without a dedicated federal protector against predatory lending and financial fraud.
- **Weakened SEC Enforcement:** Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement was redirected away from corporate fraud and market manipulation, allowing insider trading and accounting fraud to proliferate while retail investors bore the losses.
- **Dismantled Dodd-Frank Protections:** Systematic rollback of post-2008 financial reforms weakened capital requirements, stress testing, and the Volcker Rule, recreating the conditions that led to the Great Recession.
- **Politicized the FDIC:** The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was compromised by political appointees who weakened bank examination standards and reduced enforcement actions, threatening the deposit insurance system that protects 124 million American households.
- **Eliminated Consumer Protections:** Payday lending rules, fair lending enforcement, and mortgage protections were rolled back, exposing low-income and minority communities to predatory financial products that strip an estimated $8 billion annually in wealth.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Restore and Strengthen the CFPB
Reinstate the CFPB's full enforcement authority, restore its independent funding through the Federal Reserve (as Congress intended in Dodd-Frank), appoint aggressive leadership, and expand its jurisdiction to cover fintech, cryptocurrency, and emerging financial products.

### 2. Strengthen SEC Market Integrity Enforcement
Rebuild the SEC's enforcement division with 500 additional attorneys, restore penalties for corporate fraud, mandate real-time market surveillance technology, and require SEC disclosure rules covering corporate political spending, climate risk, and executive compensation.

### 3. Fortify Systemic Risk Protections
Restore and strengthen Dodd-Frank capital requirements, stress testing, and the Volcker Rule; designate systemically important financial institutions with enhanced oversight; and establish a Financial Stability Oversight Council with real enforcement authority.

### 4. Expand FDIC Deposit Protection
Increase FDIC deposit insurance limits to reflect modern economic reality, strengthen bank examination standards, and ensure the Deposit Insurance Fund is adequately capitalized through risk-based assessments on the largest institutions.

### 5. Regulate Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets
Establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, stablecoins, and digital assets that protects consumers, prevents money laundering, and addresses systemic risk while allowing responsible innovation.

### 6. Enforce Fair Lending and Combat Financial Discrimination
Rebuild fair lending enforcement at the CFPB, FDIC, and OCC; use disparate impact analysis to identify discriminatory lending patterns; and impose significant penalties on institutions that engage in redlining, predatory targeting, or discriminatory pricing.

### 7. Modernize Financial Regulation for the 21st Century
Update regulatory frameworks to address fintech, algorithmic trading, artificial intelligence in lending decisions, and the concentration of financial services in technology platforms, ensuring consumer protection keeps pace with innovation.
