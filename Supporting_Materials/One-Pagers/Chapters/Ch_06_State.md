# Chapter 6: Department of State -- One-Pager

## What the State Department Does

The Department of State is the lead instrument of American foreign policy -- responsible for diplomacy, alliance management, treaty obligations, refugee protection, consular services, and the cultivation of relationships and institutions that have underwritten international stability since 1945. At its core, the Department is a repository of irreplaceable human expertise: career Foreign Service Officers who speak the languages, know the cultures, and maintain the relationships that no political appointee can replicate. The State Department's authority derives from Article II of the Constitution, the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 3901), the State Department Basic Authorities Act (22 U.S.C. 2651), and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151).

## What Project 2025 Did to the State Department

- **Purged the Career Foreign Service:** More than 1,350 employees fired outright in July 2025 alone -- the largest forced reduction in the department's history. An additional 1,600 departed through coerced voluntary retirement, bringing total departures to approximately 3,000 in the first year. Nearly 30 career ambassadors were recalled from overseas posts and replaced with political loyalists. The average departing officer had approximately 12 years of experience. The proposed FY2026 budget of $28.4 billion was a 47.8% cut from the enacted FY2025 level of $54.4 billion.

- **Dissolved USAID and Froze Foreign Aid:** Froze all foreign assistance on January 20, 2025. By March, 83% of USAID programs -- approximately 5,200 contracts -- had been terminated. On July 1, 2025, USAID ceased to exist as an independent agency after 64 years. Federal courts ruled these actions likely unconstitutional, citing violations of the Impoundment Control Act. Hundreds of millions of aid beneficiaries were affected worldwide.

- **Withdrew from Multilateral Institutions:** Pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, the World Health Organization, and the UN Human Rights Council on Day One. Eliminated funding for most international organizations, including the UN, NATO administrative budgets, and dozens of multilateral bodies. Congress approved $9 billion in rescissions from foreign assistance and international organization funding.

- **Degraded Alliances:** Conditioned NATO Article 5 commitments on spending benchmarks -- a repudiation of the unconditional mutual defense commitment that is the alliance's foundation. Pursued coercive territorial claims against Greenland, the Panama Canal, and Canada, transforming allies into adversaries. Created the first genuine crisis of confidence in Article 5 since NATO's founding in 1949.

- **Capitulated on Ukraine:** Administration envoys considered recognizing Russian-held Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. A 28-point peace plan released in November 2025 proposed granting Russia parts of eastern Ukraine it did not even control, in exchange for an unenforceable U.S. security guarantee. European allies accelerated independent defense planning on the assumption that U.S. commitments cannot be trusted.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Rebuild the Career Foreign Service
Reinstate all wrongfully fired officers with back pay within 60 days. Reverse all politicized dismissals. End Schedule F application to State Department positions permanently. Fund a multi-year hiring surge to restore staffing to FY2024 levels within 24 months. End political donor ambassador appointments at all strategically significant posts.

### 2. Rejoin Multilateral Institutions on Day One
Issue executive orders rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, the World Health Organization, and the UN Human Rights Council within the first 24 hours. Pay all arrears to the UN and international organizations within 90 days. Re-engage with the WTO, ICC, and international financial institutions.

### 3. Reconstitute USAID as an Independent Agency
Restore USAID's independent status, professional leadership, and full budget within 60 days. Enact the USAID Restoration Act to codify independence and prevent future executive dissolution, with a minimum $25 billion annual appropriation indexed to inflation.

### 4. Recommit to NATO and Alliance Restoration
Reaffirm unconditional commitment to NATO Article 5 by presidential statement on Day One. Conduct presidential visit to NATO headquarters and bilateral visits to all frontline allies within 30 days. Formally disavow all coercive territorial claims. Conduct alliance reassurance tours to the Indo-Pacific within 45 days, Latin America within 60 days, and Africa within 90 days.

### 5. Restore Refugee Admissions
Set the annual refugee ceiling at 125,000 persons. Rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program infrastructure. Enact the Refugee Admissions Restoration Act setting a statutory floor of 95,000 annual admissions that the President cannot reduce without a joint resolution of Congress.

### 6. Hold Russia Accountable on Ukraine
Restore full U.S. security assistance to Ukraine on Day One. Reaffirm U.S. refusal to recognize Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory. Maintain and strengthen sanctions, military assistance, and diplomatic pressure. Appoint the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice and direct atrocity documentation.

### 7. Establish a Strategic China Framework
Develop a coherent, sustained strategic competition framework for China that does not sacrifice Taiwan or regional allies to trade deals. Publish a Quadrennial China Strategy. Negotiate a bilateral trade agreement framework with Taiwan demonstrating U.S. economic commitment independent of Chinese pressure.

### 8. Restore Climate and Human Rights Diplomacy
Appropriate $3 billion annually for international climate finance through the Climate Diplomacy Authorization Act. Restore the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to full authority. Enforce the Global Magnitsky Act with at least 50 new sanctions designations annually.
