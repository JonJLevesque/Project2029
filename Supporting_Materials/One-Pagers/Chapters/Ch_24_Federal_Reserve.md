# Chapter 24: Federal Reserve System -- One-Pager

## What the Federal Reserve Does

The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States, established by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (12 U.S.C. 221 et seq.). Its dual mandate -- maximum employment and stable prices -- is codified in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978. The Fed sets monetary policy through the Federal Open Market Committee, supervises more than 900 bank holding companies, serves as the lender of last resort, operates the nation's payment infrastructure, and maintains a balance sheet exceeding $7 trillion. Its independence from political control is the structural guarantee that interest rate decisions serve economic conditions rather than electoral calendars.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Federal Reserve

- **Attacked Fed Independence:** Project 2025 proposed subjecting Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions to direct presidential oversight and real-time congressional audit, threatening the operational independence that prevents politically-motivated interest rate manipulation.
- **Sought to Eliminate the Dual Mandate:** Proposed reducing the Fed's mandate to price stability alone, abandoning the maximum employment objective that ensures monetary policy serves working Americans, not just financial markets.
- **Targeted Financial Supervision:** Called for stripping the Fed of bank supervision authority and weakening stress testing requirements, reducing the safeguards that prevent another 2008-style financial crisis.
- **Opposed Climate Risk Integration:** Blocked the Fed from incorporating climate-related financial risk into supervision and stress testing, ignoring the systemic economic threat posed by climate change to the banking system.
- **Undermined Payment System Modernization:** Opposed FedNow expansion and resisted real-time payment infrastructure improvements that would benefit consumers and small businesses competing against large bank-dominated payment networks.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Federal Reserve Independence Protection Act
Codify Fed operational independence by statute, prohibit presidential directives on interest rate decisions, establish clear boundaries between legitimate oversight and political interference, and create legal penalties for attempts to coerce monetary policy decisions.

### 2. Strengthened Dual Mandate with Full Employment Priority
Reaffirm and strengthen the dual mandate by defining maximum employment with specific metrics (unemployment below 4%, labor force participation targets, wage growth benchmarks), ensuring the Fed prioritizes job creation alongside price stability.

### 3. Financial Stability and Macroprudential Supervision
Restore and expand the Fed's supervisory authority, strengthen stress testing requirements for systemically important financial institutions, close regulatory gaps exposed by the 2023 regional bank failures, and establish a dedicated macroprudential division.

### 4. Climate Financial Risk Integration
Require the Fed to incorporate climate-related financial risk into bank supervision, stress testing, and financial stability monitoring. Mandate climate risk scenario analysis for all banks with $100 billion+ in assets.

### 5. Fed Governance and Diversity Reform
Reform the Federal Reserve Board and Regional Bank governance to ensure diverse representation, require that Regional Fed Bank presidents are appointed through transparent processes with public input, and end the dominance of large bank executives on Regional Fed boards.

### 6. Real-Time Payment Infrastructure Expansion
Accelerate FedNow deployment to achieve universal adoption, mandate that all federally-insured banks offer FedNow access, and ensure the payment system serves consumers and small businesses rather than reinforcing large bank advantages.

### 7. Community Reinvestment and Equitable Credit Access
Modernize the Community Reinvestment Act framework, strengthen Fed enforcement of fair lending requirements, and establish dedicated Fed programs supporting credit access in underserved communities.

### 8. Fed Transparency and Democratic Accountability
Expand FOMC meeting transcripts and deliberation transparency (with appropriate time delays), require the Fed to publish distributional impact analyses of major policy decisions, and establish a public advisory council representing labor, consumers, and community organizations.

### 9. Digital Currency and Financial Innovation Framework
Develop a comprehensive framework for central bank digital currency (CBDC) that protects privacy, expands financial inclusion, and maintains the dollar's role in the global financial system while preventing private cryptocurrency from undermining monetary policy transmission.

## Why Fed Independence Matters

Every historical episode of political interference in central banking has produced the same result: short-term political gain followed by inflation, financial instability, and economic damage that falls hardest on working families. Nixon's pressure on Arthur Burns produced the stagflation crisis. Turkey's erosion of central bank independence produced 85% inflation. The lesson is clear: when politicians control interest rates, they cut rates before elections and leave citizens to pay the price. Fed independence is not an abstraction -- it is the structural wall between sound monetary policy and political manipulation.
