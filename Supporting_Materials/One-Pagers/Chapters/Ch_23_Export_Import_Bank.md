# Chapter 23: Export-Import Bank of the United States -- One-Pager

## What EXIM Does

The Export-Import Bank (EXIM) is the official export credit agency of the United States, established in 1934 and operating under the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635 et seq.). EXIM fills the gap when private sector lenders will not finance U.S. exports -- providing direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance to foreign buyers of American goods and services. It is self-sustaining: EXIM collects fees and premiums that cover its administrative costs and has returned billions in net revenue to the U.S. Treasury over its history. In FY2024, EXIM authorized $8.4 billion in financing, supporting approximately 38,000 American jobs across all 50 states. American exporters competing for contracts in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America do not compete against private lenders -- they compete against the Chinese state.

## What Project 2025 Did to EXIM

- **Proposed Complete Abolition:** Project 2025 called for eliminating the Export-Import Bank entirely, labeling it "corporate welfare" and arguing private markets can finance U.S. exports without government support.
- **Ignored the China Competition:** China's Export-Import Bank and China Development Bank provide an estimated $300+ billion in state-backed export financing, with over $289 billion in outstanding Belt and Road Initiative loans. Abolishing EXIM would unilaterally disarm the U.S. in this economic competition.
- **Repeated the Quorum Crisis Damage:** The 2015-2019 quorum crisis -- when Senate obstruction paralyzed EXIM for four years -- cost the U.S. economy an estimated $20 billion in overseas opportunities and nearly 250,000 potential jobs. Project 2025 would make that loss permanent.
- **Abandoned Small Business Exporters:** Small businesses account for approximately 90% of EXIM transactions by number. Private markets do not serve these exporters -- they lack the credit profiles to obtain commercial export financing on their own.
- **Surrendered Strategic Markets:** Without EXIM, American companies competing for infrastructure contracts in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia would face Chinese state-backed competitors with no comparable financing tool.
- **Undermined Clean Energy Exports:** Failed to expand EXIM financing for renewable energy technology, battery storage, and clean transportation exports at the precise moment global demand for clean energy infrastructure is surging.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Permanent Reauthorization with Anti-Lapse Protections
Permanently reauthorize EXIM by statute, eliminate the recurring reauthorization cycle that creates political vulnerability, require Senate-confirmed Board members, and establish automatic quorum provisions preventing future paralysis.

### 2. China Competition Window
Create a dedicated $50 billion authorization window specifically for countering Chinese state-backed financing in strategic sectors including clean energy, critical minerals, telecommunications infrastructure, and transportation.

### 3. Clean Energy Export Financing Expansion
Establish a Clean Energy Export Initiative with a dedicated $20 billion financing authorization for renewable energy technology, grid modernization equipment, battery storage systems, and clean transportation infrastructure exports.

### 4. Small Business Export Acceleration
Expand small business authorization targets from 25% to 40% of total financing, create a streamlined small business application process with 30-day approval timelines, and establish regional small business export hubs in partnership with SBA district offices.

### 5. Supply Chain Resilience Financing
Create a new Supply Chain Diversification Window providing financing for exports that help allied nations reduce dependence on Chinese manufacturing, with priority for semiconductor equipment, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and critical mineral processing.

### 6. Labor and Environmental Standards Integration
Require that all EXIM-financed projects above $25 million comply with ILO core labor standards and Paris Agreement-consistent environmental standards, ensuring American export financing does not subsidize labor exploitation or environmental destruction.

### 7. Congressional Accountability and Transparency
Require quarterly reporting to Congress on authorization levels, geographic distribution, sector allocation, jobs supported, default rates, and China competition metrics, with an annual public "State of American Exports" report.

### 8. Workforce Development and Domestic Content
Require that EXIM-financed exports meet domestic content thresholds, link EXIM programs to workforce development initiatives that train American workers for export manufacturing, and create apprenticeship coordination with the Department of Labor for industries receiving significant EXIM support.

## Day One Executive Actions

- Direct EXIM to immediately resume processing all pending applications frozen during the transition
- Issue an executive order prioritizing EXIM financing for clean energy exports and China competition sectors
- Nominate qualified EXIM Board members to ensure a functioning quorum within 60 days
- Direct EXIM to publish a 90-day review of all transactions lost to Chinese competitors during the policy freeze
- Reinstate all terminated EXIM staff and reverse any pending workforce reductions
- Direct EXIM to accelerate small business application processing with a 30-day approval target

## By The Numbers

- **$8.4 billion:** EXIM financing authorized in FY2024, supporting 38,000 American jobs across all 50 states
- **$300+ billion:** Chinese state-backed export financing annually -- the competition EXIM faces
- **$289 billion:** Outstanding Belt and Road Initiative loans from Chinese state lenders
- **$20 billion:** Estimated U.S. economic losses from the 2015-2019 EXIM quorum crisis
- **250,000 jobs:** Potential American jobs lost during the four-year quorum crisis
- **90%:** Share of EXIM transactions (by number) that support small businesses
- **$50 billion:** Proposed China Competition Window authorization
- **$20 billion:** Proposed Clean Energy Export Initiative authorization
- **$200 billion:** Proposed expanded EXIM exposure cap (up from current levels)

## Key Legislation Proposed

- **EXIM Permanent Reauthorization and Reform Act** -- Permanently reauthorize EXIM, establish anti-lapse quorum protections, and expand the exposure cap to $200 billion
- **China Competition Export Financing Act** -- Create a dedicated $50 billion authorization window for countering Chinese state-backed financing in strategic sectors
- **Clean Energy Export Acceleration Act** -- Establish a $20 billion dedicated clean energy export financing authorization with streamlined approval processes
- **Small Business Export Access Act** -- Increase the small business authorization target to 40%, create 30-day approval timelines, and establish regional export hubs

## Constitutional and Legal Basis

- Commerce Clause and Foreign Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8)
- Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635 et seq.)
- Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2019
- Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1)

## How to Take Action

- **Read the full chapter:** [Chapter 23: Export-Import Bank](../../../Section4_The_Economy/Chapter_23_Export_Import_Bank.md)
- **Contact your representatives:** Demand permanent EXIM reauthorization and expanded financing to compete with China
- **Share this one-pager:** Help others understand why export financing is essential to American jobs and competitiveness
- **Join the movement:** Support manufacturing and export organizations advocating for strong EXIM authorization
- **Support small business exporters:** Connect local businesses with EXIM resources and regional export hubs

## Implementation Timeline

- **Day 1:** Resume all frozen applications, nominate Board members, issue clean energy financing executive order
- **90 Days:** Publish lost-transaction review; restore all staff; begin processing backlog
- **Year 1:** Permanent reauthorization legislation submitted; China Competition Window established; small business 30-day approval process operational
- **Years 2-4:** Clean Energy Export Initiative fully operational; exposure cap expanded to $200 billion; labor and environmental standards integrated into all major transactions

## The China Competition Challenge

The Heritage Foundation's proposal to abolish EXIM ignores the central reality of 21st-century trade: American exporters do not compete against private lenders -- they compete against the Chinese state. China's Export-Import Bank and China Development Bank together provide $300+ billion in state-backed financing. Belt and Road Initiative loans have locked in Chinese infrastructure across 147 countries. Without EXIM, American companies have no comparable financing tool, and every lost contract is a lost market for a generation.
