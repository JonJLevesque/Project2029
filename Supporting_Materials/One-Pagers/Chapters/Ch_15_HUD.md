# Chapter 15: Department of Housing and Urban Development -- One-Pager

## What HUD Does

The Department of Housing and Urban Development administers federal housing policy, enforces fair housing laws under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. Section 3601-3619), funds public housing and Section 8 rental assistance, distributes Community Development Block Grants, and coordinates the national response to homelessness through the McKinney-Vento Act. HUD's mission is to ensure Americans have access to fair, affordable, and adequate housing -- a mission that directly affects the 50% of renters who are cost-burdened and the 650,000 Americans homeless on any given night.

## What Project 2025 Did to HUD

- **Gutted Fair Housing Enforcement:** Rescinded the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule that required HUD-funded jurisdictions to assess and address segregation. Reduced civil rights staff, dropped discrimination investigations, eliminated housing discrimination testing programs, and allowed source-of-income discrimination to continue concentrating voucher holders in high-poverty areas.
- **Abandoned Affordable Housing:** Cut public housing capital funds by 50%+ (NYCHA alone has $40 billion in unmet needs), stagnated Section 8 funding so that only 1 in 4 eligible families receives assistance with 2-10 year wait lists, and relied on LIHTC production of just 100,000 units annually -- one-fifth the need.
- **Criminalized Homelessness:** Supported the Supreme Court decision allowing cities to criminalize sleeping outdoors, funded "homeless sweeps" that destroyed belongings and disrupted services, while investing nothing in permanent housing solutions. Homelessness reached the highest levels since tracking began: 650,000+ on any given night.
- **Enabled Wall Street Landlords:** Allowed institutional investors (Blackstone, Invitation Homes, American Homes 4 Rent) to acquire 30%+ of single-family rentals in some markets, raising rents 10-20% annually with aggressive eviction practices. Short-term rentals (Airbnb/VRBO) removed 1 million+ units from the rental market.
- **Deepened the Affordability Crisis:** Median rent increased 30%+ since 2019. Twenty-five percent of renters are severely cost-burdened (paying over 50% of income on housing). Median home price exceeded $400,000, making homeownership increasingly unattainable. One medical bill, job loss, or crisis away from eviction for millions of working families.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. National Social Housing Program ($50 Billion Annually)
Adopt the Vienna/Singapore model of high-quality, mixed-income public housing as a public good, not a welfare program. Produce 100,000 units in Year 1, scaling to 200,000 annually, with a target of 30% of housing stock as social housing by 2050 (3 million units by Year 20). Mixed-income requirements eliminate stigma: 30% very low income, 30% low income, 20% moderate income, 20% middle income -- all paying 30% of income or below market rate.

### 2. Housing First Homelessness Elimination ($20 Billion Annually)
Provide permanent housing immediately with wrap-around services -- no preconditions of sobriety, treatment, or employment. Deploy 100,000 permanent supportive housing units and 200,000 rapid rehousing placements over five years. Housing First achieves 80-90% success rates (vs. 40-50% for traditional shelters) and costs less than cycling people through emergency rooms, jails, and shelters. Target: functional zero chronic homelessness in 25+ cities within five years. Model: Utah reduced chronic homelessness 91% in ten years.

### 3. Community Land Trusts ($10 Billion Annually)
Fund nonprofit land trusts that acquire land permanently, ensuring housing remains affordable forever through resale formulas. CLT homeowners build equity while prices stay accessible. Model: Champlain Housing Trust (Burlington, VT) -- 3,000+ units with less than 1% foreclosure rate during the 2008 crisis (vs. 7% national average).

### 4. Anti-NIMBY Zoning Preemption
Federal legislation requiring as-of-right multifamily zoning within half a mile of transit stations (minimum 30-50 units/acre), conditioning federal transportation funding on zoning reform, mandating ADU legalization nationwide, and eliminating parking minimums near transit. Addresses the fact that 75% of residential land in major metros is zoned single-family only, blocking housing production where it is needed most.

### 5. Rent Stabilization Framework
Override state preemption of local rent control (21 states currently prohibit it), establish anti-gouging standards capping annual increases at inflation + 3% for buildings 15+ years old, require just cause eviction protections, and guarantee tenant right to renew leases in good standing. Enables local action without mandating national rent control. Includes relocation assistance (3 months' rent) for no-fault evictions.

### 6. Fair Housing Restoration
Reinstate AFFH requiring all HUD-funded jurisdictions to assess and address segregation, with fund withholding for non-compliance. Enact federal source-of-income protection so landlords cannot refuse Section 8 vouchers. Require algorithm auditing for mortgage lending to prevent AI-driven discrimination. Triple HUD FHEO staff. Budget: $500 million annually for enforcement.

### 7. Green Affordable Housing
All new federally funded housing must meet net-zero energy standards (approximately 5% cost premium offset by lower operating costs). Invest $10 billion over 10 years in deep energy retrofits for public housing to Energy Star standard. Achieve 100% lead-safe public housing by 2030. Remediate asbestos, mold, and radon in all federally funded housing.

## Constitutional and Legal Basis

- **Fair Housing Act** (42 U.S.C. Section 3601-3619): Prohibits housing discrimination; Texas Dept. of Housing v. Inclusive Communities (2015) upholds disparate impact claims
- **Commerce Clause** (Art. I, Section 8, cl. 3): Housing markets are interstate commerce (construction materials, financing, migration)
- **Spending Clause:** Condition federal funds on fair housing, zoning reform, and Housing First approaches
- **Supremacy Clause** (Art. VI): Federal preemption of discriminatory local laws and state rent control preemption
- **McKinney-Vento Act** (42 U.S.C. Section 11301 et seq.): Federal authority to address homelessness through Housing First
- **Gonzales v. Raich** (2005): Congress can regulate local activities substantially affecting interstate commerce
- **Hills v. Gautreaux** (1976): Housing remedies can cross jurisdictional lines; regional approaches permissible

## The Bottom Line

Housing is a human right. Vienna, Singapore, and Finland prove that government can provide high-quality housing, eliminate homelessness, and create inclusive communities. America has the resources. What it has lacked is the political will. Project 2029 provides the blueprint.
