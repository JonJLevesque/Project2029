# Chapter 31: Constitutional Hardball — One-Pager

## What This Chapter Covers
The preceding chapters outlined accountability, structural safeguards, and transformative reforms through proper constitutional processes. This chapter confronts a hard truth: playing by rules that your opponent ignores is a losing strategy. It details aggressive but legal tactics available to a President committed to democratic restoration -- not norm violations, but the full exercise of constitutional and statutory authority that has been left dormant by timid administrations. Every tactic rests on explicit legal authorization and established precedent.

## What Project 2025 Did / The Current Crisis
- **Exploited Democratic Restraint:** For decades, Republicans violated norms (eliminating filibuster for judges, stealing the Garland seat, rushing Barrett, weaponizing DOJ) while Democrats self-limited. The result: continuous Democratic losses while congratulating themselves for civility.
- **Proved Aggressive Tactics Work:** Project 2025 demonstrated that aggressive use of executive power, exploitation of legal gray areas, and willingness to push constitutional boundaries can accomplish massive change rapidly. If these tactics are legitimate when Republicans use them, they are legitimate when Democrats use them.
- **Created Urgent Democratic Crisis:** The documented subversion of 2025-2029 (39 federal judges ruling against the administration, criminal contempt findings, systematic oversight dismantling) means democracy itself is at stake. Unilateral disarmament is political suicide.
- **Established Legal Precedent:** Trump's emergency declarations, recess appointments, acting officials, and Day 1 executive order reversals all set precedent that a democratic administration can use for restoration rather than destruction.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Day 1 Executive Blitz
Sign 20+ executive orders reversing Project 2025; declare national emergency for democracy crisis (unlocking IEEPA asset freeze, Defense Production Act, and Stafford Act powers); launch IRS dark money enforcement blitz; make FEC recess appointments to break the 3-3 enforcement deadlock.

### 2. Eliminate the Senate Filibuster
Senate votes to change Rule XXII to allow cloture by simple majority. The Constitution says nothing about filibusters. Republicans already eliminated it for judges in 2017. This single action unlocks the entire reform agenda.

### 3. Expand the Supreme Court to 13 Justices
Pass legislation expanding the Court from 9 to 13, matching the 13 federal circuit courts. Congress has changed Court size 6 times (1789-1869). Nominate and confirm 4 new justices to restore balance after the Garland seat theft and Barrett rushed confirmation.

### 4. DC and Puerto Rico Statehood
Admit both as states under Article IV, Section 3 (simple majority, 37 states admitted this way). Adds 4 new senators, transforms Senate math, and enfranchises 3.9 million Americans currently without voting representation.

### 5. DOJ Enforcement Priority Reset
Direct the Attorney General to prioritize voting rights litigation (sue 30+ states), FARA prosecutions (500+ non-compliant firms), campaign finance enforcement, public corruption task force, and antitrust against media monopolies.

### 6. SEC Corporate Political Spending Disclosure
Require all public companies to disclose political spending to shareholders via SEC rulemaking authority (Securities Exchange Act 14(a)). Expected to reduce corporate political spending by 50%+ due to reputational risk.

### 7. Democracy Protection Legislative Package
Within the first 3 months: pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, For the People Act, Democracy Dollars Act, Lobbying Reform Act, Congressional Stock Trading Ban, and binding Supreme Court ethics code. Filibuster elimination makes this possible.

### 8. Revenue Package to Fund Reforms
Wealth tax (2% over $50M, 3% over $1B), financial transaction tax (0.01%), close corporate offshore loopholes, and carbon tax ($50/ton rising $10/year). Total new revenue: $575 billion/year. Funds Medicare for All, free public college, and universal pre-K.

## Day One Executive Actions
- Sign 20+ executive orders reversing all Project 2025 executive actions
- Declare national emergency under National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601)
- Direct IRS to audit top 200 dark money groups for 501(c)(4) tax law violations
- Make recess appointments to FEC creating a pro-enforcement majority
- Issue DOJ enforcement priorities memo covering voting rights, FARA, and public corruption
- Reinstate all fired Inspectors General with expanded investigative authority

## By The Numbers
- **20+ executive orders:** To be signed on Day 1 reversing Project 2025 actions
- **6 times:** Number of times Congress has changed the size of the Supreme Court
- **$2-3 billion:** Dark money spending per election cycle that IRS enforcement can eliminate
- **30+ states:** To be sued simultaneously for voter suppression under the Voting Rights Act
- **$575 billion/year:** New revenue from wealth tax, financial transaction tax, and carbon tax
- **6-12 months:** Window for action before midterm dynamics narrow the political opening

## Key Legislation Proposed
- **Judiciary Act of 2029** -- Expand the Supreme Court from 9 to 13 justices, matching federal circuit courts
- **DC Statehood Act** -- Admit the District of Columbia as the 51st state with full congressional representation
- **Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act** -- Authorize binding statehood referendum and admission process
- **Democracy Protection Package** -- Omnibus bill combining voting rights restoration, campaign finance reform, lobbying ban, and ethics enforcement
