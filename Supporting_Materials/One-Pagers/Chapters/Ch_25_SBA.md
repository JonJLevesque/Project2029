# Chapter 25: Small Business Administration -- One-Pager

## What the SBA Does

The Small Business Administration is the federal government's primary institution for supporting the 33 million small businesses that employ 61 million Americans -- nearly half the private-sector workforce. The SBA operates the 7(a) and 504 loan guarantee programs that channel hundreds of billions in capital to businesses that commercial banks will not fully finance, administers the SBIC venture capital program, processes disaster loans, manages the 8(a) Business Development program and contracting set-asides for minority-owned, women-owned, veteran-owned, and HUBZone businesses, and funds the 1,000-center Small Business Development Center (SBDC) network and SCORE mentorship program.

## What Project 2025 Did to the SBA

- **Gutted Lending Programs:** Proposed reducing or restructuring SBA loan guarantee programs, making it harder for small businesses to access the capital that commercial banks refuse to provide, disproportionately harming entrepreneurs in underserved communities.
- **Attacked Contracting Set-Asides:** Targeted the 8(a) Business Development program and minority contracting set-asides for elimination or reduction, undermining the federal government's most effective tool for building minority business capacity.
- **Defunded Small Business Development Centers:** Cut funding for the 1,000-center SBDC network that provides free counseling, training, and technical assistance to millions of entrepreneurs annually.
- **Undermined Disaster Loan Processing:** Reduced SBA staffing and capacity for disaster loan processing at a time when climate-driven disasters are increasing in frequency and severity, leaving small businesses and homeowners without timely recovery assistance.
- **Eliminated Equity Programs:** Targeted women's business centers, veteran entrepreneurship programs, and community-based lending initiatives for reduction, narrowing access to entrepreneurship for the populations that need it most.
- **Weakened HUBZone and Rural Programs:** Reduced support for Historically Underutilized Business Zone designations and rural entrepreneurship programs, further concentrating federal contracting benefits in metropolitan areas with established contractor bases.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. SBA Lending Program Expansion and Modernization
Increase 7(a) loan guarantee limits, expand 504 program eligibility, create a new Microloan Plus program for loans under $150,000 with streamlined approval, and reduce fee structures that make SBA loans more expensive than conventional financing for the borrowers who can least afford it.

### 2. 8(a) Business Development Program Strengthening
Expand the 8(a) program, increase sole-source contract thresholds, extend program participation timelines, and create graduation support services ensuring businesses that complete the program maintain their competitiveness in open federal procurement.

### 3. Disaster Loan Modernization
Overhaul the disaster loan program with pre-approved credit lines for businesses in disaster-prone areas, 72-hour emergency disbursement for initial recovery funds, expanded loan limits, and permanent surge staffing capacity so the SBA is not overwhelmed by each successive disaster.

### 4. SBDC Network Expansion
Increase SBDC funding by 50%, open centers in every county with more than 50,000 residents that currently lacks one, and create specialized technology entrepreneurship, export assistance, and climate resilience tracks within the SBDC curriculum.

### 5. Community Advantage and CDFI Partnership Program
Create a permanent Community Advantage lending program in partnership with Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), targeting capital access in communities where traditional SBA lenders do not operate -- rural areas, tribal lands, and low-income urban neighborhoods.

### 6. Federal Contracting Equity
Increase the government-wide small business contracting goal from 23% to 30%, establish binding agency-by-agency targets with consequences for non-compliance, and create a real-time public contracting dashboard tracking progress.

### 7. Veteran and Military Spouse Entrepreneurship
Expand the Boots to Business program, create dedicated veteran small business loan pools with reduced fees, and establish a military spouse portable business license program enabling military families to operate businesses across state lines during relocations.

### 8. Climate Resilience for Small Businesses
Create a Small Business Climate Adaptation program providing grants, technical assistance, and low-interest loans for small businesses to invest in climate resilience -- including flood protection, energy efficiency, backup power, and supply chain diversification. Integrate climate risk assessment into all SBDC counseling services.

## Why Small Business Matters

Small businesses are not a sentimental category -- they are the backbone of the American economy. The 33 million small businesses in the United States employ 61 million workers, generate two-thirds of net new jobs, and account for 44% of U.S. economic activity. When the SBA is functional, entrepreneurs in every community can access capital, training, and federal contracts. When it is gutted, the gap is filled by large corporations with existing relationships and access. Every reduction in SBA capacity is a transfer of economic opportunity from Main Street to Wall Street.
