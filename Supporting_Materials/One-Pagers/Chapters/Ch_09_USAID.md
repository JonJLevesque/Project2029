# Chapter 9: U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) -- One-Pager

## What USAID Does

The U.S. Agency for International Development was established by President Kennedy in 1961 under the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. 2151) as the primary instrument of American soft power and humanitarian leadership. For sixty-four years, USAID administered development assistance, global health programs, food aid, democracy promotion, and disaster response across more than 100 countries. USAID trained foreign health workers who contained pandemics before they crossed American borders, supported civil society organizations that checked authoritarian governments, funded programs that prevented famine in the world's most fragile states, and kept 20.6 million HIV-positive individuals alive through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). It was not charity -- it was strategic statecraft backed by congressional authority and decades of bipartisan consensus.

## What Project 2025 Did to USAID

- **Total Agency Destruction:** DOGE -- operating without Senate confirmation, security clearances, or statutory authority -- froze all foreign assistance, placed 4,700 employees on administrative leave, terminated 1,600 positions outright, canceled 5,200 contracts representing 83% of all programs, and dismantled the agency's IT systems, websites, and physical facilities. On July 1, 2025, USAID officially ceased to exist as an independent agency after 64 years of operation.

- **Devastated PEPFAR and Global Health:** The January 24 stop-work order froze HIV treatment funding for 20.6 million patients, including 550,000 children. In Mozambique alone, 15,000 fewer people started antiretroviral treatment in the first four months compared to 2024. Peer-reviewed modeling projects 85,000 additional HIV infections and 25,000 additional deaths if cuts persist through 2030. UNAIDS documented that the freeze jeopardized care for all 20.6 million individuals in PEPFAR programs.

- **Caused Global Food Crisis:** Terminated approximately $5 billion in annual food assistance -- the United States was the world's largest single contributor. The World Food Programme projected a 34% reduction in resources, eliminating assistance for up to 16.7 million people. Programs cancelled in Afghanistan (half the population dependent on aid), Haiti (5.7 million facing acute hunger), Syria ($230 million terminated), and Yemen (the world's worst humanitarian crisis).

- **Destroyed Democracy Programs:** Democracy, rights, and governance programming was terminated at a rate exceeding 97% -- the highest cancellation rate of any USAID program category. Programs supporting civil society, independent media, election monitors, and human rights defenders in 120+ countries were eliminated. Authoritarian governments in Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and El Salvador openly celebrated USAID's demise.

- **Violated the Constitution:** Federal courts ruled the dismantling likely unconstitutional, finding DOGE had no legal authority to destroy a congressionally created agency and had violated the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The District Court found that Musk and DOGE had deprived Congress of "its constitutional authority to decide whether, when and how to close down an agency created by Congress." The administration defied these rulings.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Reconstitute USAID on Day One
Issue Executive Order reconstituting USAID as an independent agency. Revoke all executive orders suspending foreign assistance or directing dissolution. Restore website, IT systems, classified networks, and physical facilities. Begin emergency reinstatement of all improperly separated employees. Convene emergency coordination with WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR, and WHO within 72 hours.

### 2. Restore PEPFAR to Full Funding
Secure continuity of HIV treatment for 20.6 million patients. Enact the PEPFAR Permanence and Continuity Act establishing a permanent $7 billion minimum annual authorization, adjusted for inflation, with 180-day congressional notice required before any restructuring. Prohibit stop-work orders affecting HIV treatment continuity.

### 3. Rebuild Food Security and Humanitarian Assistance
Restore Food for Peace programs and WFP contributions. Submit $3 billion emergency supplemental appropriations within 100 days. Enact the Global Food Security Permanence Act establishing a $5 billion minimum annual commitment. Prioritize Afghanistan, Haiti, Syria, and Yemen. Restore FEWS NET monitoring in all previously covered countries.

### 4. Codify USAID Independence in Permanent Law
Enact the USAID Statutory Independence Act establishing USAID as an independent agency by statute, prohibiting merger with the State Department without an act of Congress, granting independent budget authority, and establishing superior civil service protections for the workforce.

### 5. Restore Democracy and Governance Programming
Rebuild civil society support, independent media funding, election monitoring, anti-corruption programs, and human rights defender protection across 120+ countries. Issue emergency grants to organizations in Ukraine, Myanmar, Belarus, Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua within the first 100 days.

### 6. Rebuild Global Health Security
Reconstruct outbreak surveillance, rapid response teams, and pandemic preparedness programs. Authorize $1.5 billion annually through the Global Health Security Investment Act. Relaunch the PREDICT program for monitoring animal-to-human pathogen spillover. Establish a $500 million emergency reserve for emerging outbreak threats.

### 7. Strengthen Impoundment Enforcement
Enact the Strengthened Impoundment Enforcement Act creating a direct private cause of action for enforcing congressional appropriations, establishing Comptroller General authority to sue for release of impounded funds, requiring obligation of all appropriated funds within 60 days, and establishing civil penalties for knowing violations.

## Day One Executive Actions

## By The Numbers

- **64 years:** USAID's operational history before being destroyed in seven months

- **16.7 million people:** Projected loss of emergency food assistance from U.S. cuts
- **5,200 contracts:** 83% of all USAID programs terminated in a six-week "review"
- **97%+ cancellation rate:** Democracy and governance programs nearly completely eliminated
- **4,700 employees:** Placed on administrative leave; 1,600 positions terminated outright
- **85,000 additional infections:** Projected HIV infections if PEPFAR cuts persist through 2030
- **28,000 new cases annually:** Dangerous infectious diseases projected from eliminated health security programs
- **34% resource reduction:** World Food Programme's projected impact from loss of U.S. contributions

## Key Legislation Proposed

- **Global Food Security Permanence Act** -- Codify $5 billion minimum annual food assistance commitment; prohibit cancellation of emergency contracts without 90-day Congressional notice and humanitarian impact assessment
- **Global Health Security Investment Act** -- Authorize $1.5 billion annually for outbreak surveillance and pandemic preparedness; establish $500 million emergency reserve; maintain 100+ career staff
- **Foreign Assistance Accountability and Oversight Act** -- Create independent oversight body with subpoena authority; mandate annual effectiveness reviews; establish whistleblower protections
- **Strengthened Impoundment Enforcement Act** -- Create private cause of action; Comptroller General enforcement authority; 60-day obligation requirement; civil penalties for violations
