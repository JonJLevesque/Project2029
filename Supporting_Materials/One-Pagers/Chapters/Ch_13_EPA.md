# Chapter 13: Environmental Protection Agency -- One-Pager

## What the EPA Does

The Environmental Protection Agency protects public health and the environment by enforcing the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and other foundational environmental laws. The EPA sets air and water quality standards, regulates toxic chemicals and pesticides, cleans up contaminated Superfund sites, and leads federal climate action. Five decades of EPA regulation have prevented hundreds of thousands of premature deaths annually and protected the air, water, and land on which all Americans depend.

## What Project 2025 Did to the EPA

- **Gutted Clean Air Protections:** Refused to strengthen particulate matter (PM2.5) standards despite scientific evidence, attempted to repeal mercury limits on power plants, froze vehicle fuel economy standards, and revoked California's Clean Air Act waiver. EPA's own analysis showed these rollbacks would cause 1,400+ premature deaths and 15,000+ new childhood asthma attacks annually.
- **Weakened Clean Water Protections:** Drastically narrowed Waters of the United States (WOTUS) protections, removing safeguards for millions of miles of streams and acres of wetlands. Delayed PFAS regulations while 77 million Americans drank water from systems with violations. Flint remains unresolved; hundreds more Flints are waiting.
- **Reversed Climate Action:** Withdrew from the Paris Agreement, repealed the Clean Power Plan, eliminated methane leak limits on oil and gas operations, exempted projects from climate impact analysis under NEPA, and locked in decades of additional carbon emissions. By 2028, these rollbacks added billions of tons of CO2 to the atmosphere.
- **Poisoned Communities with Toxic Chemicals:** Delayed regulation of PFAS "forever chemicals" contaminating millions of drinking water supplies, weakened lead paint rules, refused to ban asbestos (still legal in the U.S.), approved chlorpyrifos pesticide over EPA scientists' objections, and weakened restrictions on neonicotinoids that are killing bee populations.
- **Collapsed Enforcement:** Cut enforcement penalties by 85%, reduced inspections by 30%, declined criminal referrals by 60%, and adopted a "cooperative" approach that let polluters off without consequences. Without enforcement, polluters operated with impunity.
- **Destroyed Scientific Integrity:** Removed independent scientists from advisory committees and replaced them with industry representatives. Imposed a "secret science" rule to exclude peer-reviewed studies. Cherry-picked data supporting deregulation. Censored scientists and climate references.
- **Eliminated Environmental Justice:** Disbanded the Office of Environmental Justice, ended community engagement programs, and approved polluting facilities in overburdened communities without cumulative impact analysis. Communities of color breathe 66% more air pollution from particulate matter than white communities.
- **Gutted Budget and Staffing:** Cut EPA budget by 30%, enforcement funding by 40%, and R&D by 50%. Reduced staff from 15,000 to 11,000, destroying institutional knowledge and crippling the agency's capacity to protect public health.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Clean Air Act Restoration
Strengthen PM2.5 standards to 8-10 micrograms per cubic meter (from current 12), tighten ozone standards to 60 ppb, restore and strengthen mercury limits, accelerate vehicle standards to 54+ MPG by 2030, and restore California's waiver. Target: 20,000+ fewer premature deaths annually by 2030.

### 2. Clean Water Act Restoration ($100 Billion Infrastructure Investment)
Repeal the narrow WOTUS rule to restore protections for drinking water sources serving 117 million Americans. Set PFAS MCLs at 4 parts per trillion. Replace all lead service lines within 10 years ($45 billion). Reduce combined sewer overflows by 50%. Restore protections for 1.5 million miles of streams.

### 3. Aggressive Climate Action
Restore power plant CO2 limits, finalize methane rules, rejoin the Paris Agreement with a 50% emission reduction commitment by 2030, require climate analysis in all NEPA reviews, and invest $150 billion in climate infrastructure including EV charging, public transit electrification, and building efficiency.

### 4. Toxic Chemical Regulation
Designate PFAS as hazardous substances under Superfund with manufacturer liability for cleanup. Ban asbestos. Ban chlorpyrifos. Strengthen neonicotinoid restrictions. Accelerate TSCA chemical safety reviews. Target: 75% decline in childhood lead poisoning cases.

### 5. Environmental Justice ($5 Billion Fund)
Restore the Office of Environmental Justice with real enforcement power. Require cumulative impact analysis for all permits in overburdened communities. Mandate community consent for new polluting facilities. Target 50% reduction in pollution exposure disparities by 2030 and 10+ Title VI enforcement actions annually.

### 6. Scientific Integrity and Enforcement Restoration
Restore independent scientific advisory committees populated by merit, not industry connections. Rebuild EPA to 18,000 staff with $15 billion annual budget. Triple inspection frequency. Increase penalties to exceed profit from violations. Target: $1 billion in annual penalties and 500+ criminal prosecutions.

### 7. NEPA Restoration
Reverse all Project 2025 NEPA rollbacks. Restore comprehensive environmental review with cumulative impact analysis, robust alternatives assessment, meaningful public participation, and mandatory climate change consideration in all Environmental Impact Statements.

### 8. Superfund and Contaminated Site Cleanup ($20 Billion Over 10 Years)
Fully fund Superfund at $2 billion annually. Accelerate PFAS contamination remediation. Clean up abandoned mines and brownfields. Pursue polluters for cleanup costs. Target: communities no longer living next to toxic waste sites.

## Day One Executive Actions

- **Day 1-100:** Initiate major rulemakings (WOTUS, NAAQS, power plant and vehicle standards, PFAS, NEPA restoration)
- **Year 1:** Final rules on air and water standards, enforcement actions doubled, $15 billion budget, 3,000 new staff hired, Superfund fully funded
- **Years 2-4:** Power sector emissions 60% below baseline, 200 counties achieving air quality attainment, 5 million lead service lines replaced, PFAS exposure declining, environmental justice disparities narrowing
- **By 2030:** U.S. on track for Paris commitments (50% GHG reduction), 80% clean electricity, zero SDWA violations, all lead pipes replaced

## Constitutional and Legal Basis

- **Commerce Clause** (Art. I, Section 8, cl. 3): Pollution crosses state lines; federal regulation prevents a race to the bottom
- **Clean Air Act** (42 USC Section 7401 et seq.): NAAQS, mobile source standards, air toxics, enforcement
- **Clean Water Act** (33 USC Section 1251 et seq.): WOTUS, NPDES permits, wetlands protection, TMDLs
- **Safe Drinking Water Act** (42 USC Section 300f et seq.): MCLs, public water system requirements
- **TSCA** (15 USC Section 2601 et seq.), **CERCLA/Superfund** (42 USC Section 9601 et seq.), **NEPA** (42 USC Section 4321 et seq.)
