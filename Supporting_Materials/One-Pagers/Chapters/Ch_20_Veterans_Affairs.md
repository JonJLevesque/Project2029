# Chapter 20: Department of Veterans Affairs -- One-Pager

## What the Department of Veterans Affairs Does

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, serving approximately 9 million enrolled veterans through 170 VA Medical Centers, more than 1,200 outpatient clinics, and a benefits administration that processes millions of disability, education, and home loan claims annually.

The VA employs roughly 480,000 workers -- more than a quarter of whom are veterans themselves -- and operates on a budget exceeding $300 billion annually. It is the concrete, day-to-day promise the nation makes to those who served under arms. Its integrated model produces demonstrably better outcomes for complex veteran needs, particularly for traumatic brain injury, PTSD, spinal cord injury, and polytrauma.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Department of Veterans Affairs

- **Mass-Fired 40,000+ VA Employees:** DOGE terminated approximately 2,400 VA staffers in the initial wave, including 3,000 nurses, 1,000 physicians, and 700 social workers. By fiscal year end, the VA experienced a net loss of more than 40,000 employees -- the first net workforce contraction in the department's history. Leaked plans called for terminating up to 83,000 additional employees.
- **Accelerated Privatization:** Proposed a $14.4 billion increase in community care funding (67 percent increase) while providing no comparable expansion to VA clinical infrastructure. Directed facilities to increase outsourcing to private providers, undermining the VA's integrated care model that produces superior outcomes for complex veteran conditions.
- **Failed on Electronic Health Records:** Maintained the Oracle-Cerner EHR contract despite catastrophic safety failures, cost escalation from $10 billion to $37 billion, and inaccessibility for veterans with disabilities in violation of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The VA was paying Oracle-Cerner an average of $100 million per month during operational pause.
- **Undermined PACT Act Implementation:** Fired approximately 2,000 claims processors central to delivering PACT Act benefits for toxic-exposed veterans, creating growing backlogs for 3.5 million eligible veterans with service-connected cancers, respiratory diseases, and neurological conditions.
- **Threatened Mental Health Infrastructure:** DOGE cuts reached Veterans Crisis Line operations and eliminated suicide prevention coordinators, while 17.5 veterans die by suicide every day -- a rate more than double that of non-veteran adults.
- **Eliminated LGBTQ+ Veteran Services:** Terminated LGBTQ+ Veteran Care Coordinator positions, disrupted gender-affirming care services for transgender veterans, and eliminated dedicated outreach to a population with significantly higher rates of PTSD, depression, and suicidality.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Halt Privatization and Restore VA Direct Care
Reverse MISSION Act community care overexpansion. Redirect the $14.4 billion community care funding increase: 50 percent to VA clinical staffing restoration, 30 percent to facility modernization, and 20 percent to genuine community care for geographically isolated veterans. Issue an executive order declaring the VHA an essential government function that cannot be privatized without an act of Congress. Require individualized clinical justification for every community care referral, ending programmatic privatization under the guise of access improvement.

### 2. Reinstate All Unlawfully Terminated Employees
Initiate reinstatement of all VA employees terminated through DOGE mass firings within 30 days, with back pay and restored benefits. These terminations violated the Civil Service Reform Act's due process protections by eliminating employees without individualized cause determinations. Achieve a net gain of 10,000 VA employees in Year 1, concentrated in claims processing, mental health, and rural clinical care.

### 3. Terminate the Oracle-Cerner EHR Contract
Commission an independent patient safety assessment within 45 days. Terminate the failed $37 billion contract and pursue recovery of overpayments. Transition to an open-source, VA-controlled EHR system built on VistA or a comparable platform, with mandatory interoperability with DoD MHS GENESIS. Require Section 508 compliance certification from an independent accessibility auditor before deployment at any VA facility.

### 4. Fully Implement the PACT Act
Establish a Toxic Exposure Claims Emergency Unit within VBA and hire 5,000 additional claims processors under expedited Title 38 hiring authorities. Reduce the PACT Act claims backlog by 40 percent in Year 1 and eliminate it entirely within 24 months. Enact the PACT Act Full Implementation and Expansion Act establishing a statutory 90-day adjudication deadline, with interim compensation beginning at day 91 for unadjudicated claims. Extend coverage to veterans exposed to toxic substances at domestic military installations.

### 5. End Veteran Homelessness by 2030
Establish a $5 billion Veteran Housing Trust Fund over five years dedicated to HUD-VASH vouchers, SSVF rapid rehousing, and permanent supportive housing development. Eliminate the HUD-VASH waitlist within 18 months. Fund 200 VA-operated transitional housing facilities. Achieve functional zero veteran homelessness in 10 target cities by Year 2 and nationally by 2030. Establish a Veteran Homelessness Czar within the Executive Office of the President.

### 6. Achieve Zero-Delay Mental Health Access
Meet the 14-day mental health appointment standard at 75 percent of VA Medical Centers within Year 1 and 95 percent within three years. Maintain Veterans Crisis Line staffing to answer all contacts within 10 seconds. Protect and expand suicide prevention coordinator positions at every VA facility -- each additional contact with a coordinator is associated with a 4 to 5 percent reduction in the odds of a suicide attempt in the following year.

### 7. Establish Women Veteran Centers at Every VA Facility
Open dedicated Women's Health Centers at 50 percent of VA Medical Centers within Year 1 and all 170 facilities within three years, with minimum staff ratios and a defined package of services including reproductive health, obstetrics, gynecology, mammography, and MST-specialized mental health. Establish a rebuttable presumption of service connection for mental health conditions in veterans reporting Military Sexual Trauma, without requiring corroborating documentation. Fund 100 additional VA Women's Health residency training positions annually.

### 8. Expand Rural Veteran Access
Establish a $1.5 billion annual Rural Veteran Healthcare Fund for rural clinic operations, mobile health units, broadband connectivity support, and rural mental health provider recruitment incentives. Deploy VA-operated mobile health units to 20 high-priority rural regions. Install 500 rural VA telehealth kiosks at post offices, libraries, and community centers. Impose a moratorium on rural clinic closures absent congressional notification, a 90-day public comment period, and a certified alternative access plan.
