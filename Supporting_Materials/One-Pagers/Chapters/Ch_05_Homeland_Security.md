# Chapter 5: Department of Homeland Security -- One-Pager

## What the Department of Homeland Security Does

The Department of Homeland Security was established in 2002 by the Homeland Security Act (6 U.S.C. SS 101 et seq.) in response to the September 11 attacks, consolidating twenty-two federal agencies under a unified structure. Its mandate is to protect the homeland from terrorism, respond to natural disasters through FEMA, secure the border, defend critical infrastructure through CISA, and conduct maritime security through the Coast Guard -- all while upholding constitutional rights. DHS encompasses ICE, CBP, FEMA, CISA, the Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and TSA.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Department of Homeland Security

- **Weaponized Immigration Enforcement:** Rescinded the sensitive locations policy on Day One (January 20, 2025), exposing churches, schools, and hospitals to ICE raids. Expanded ICE detention to a record 66,000 people by December 2025. Arrested 261 DACA beneficiaries and deported 86 of them despite their lawful presence.
- **Invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798:** Deported 238 Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador's CECOT maximum-security prison without hearings, in defiance of a federal court's temporary restraining order. Documented abuse at CECOT included conditions the court found violated constitutional due process.
- **Destroyed the Asylum System:** Terminated the CBP One appointment system, suspending the primary lawful pathway for asylum seekers. Reinstated family separation as a deterrence tool. Curtailed credible fear interviews in violation of 8 U.S.C. SS 1225(b)(1).
- **Gutted CISA Cybersecurity Defense:** DOGE terminated approximately 1,300 CISA positions -- nearly 40% of the workforce -- while foreign adversaries escalated attacks on critical infrastructure. Eliminated threat hunting contracts and defunded election security coordination.
- **Hollowed Out FEMA:** Lost approximately 2,000 FEMA employees. Attempted to end the BRIC pre-disaster mitigation program. Politicized disaster aid by denying assistance to states based on partisan considerations. Proposed eliminating FEMA entirely.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Reinstate and Codify the Sensitive Locations Policy
Immediately restore protections for churches, schools, hospitals, and courthouses from immigration enforcement. Codify these protections in statute to prevent future rescission by executive action.

### 2. Restore the Asylum System
Rebuild the asylum system in full compliance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. SS 1158) and the 1967 Refugee Protocol. Restore credible fear interviews, CBP One or a successor lawful scheduling system, and immigration court access. End family separation.

### 3. End Alien Enemies Act Abuse
Renounce invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for immigration enforcement. Pursue legislative repeal of the Act for non-wartime applications.

### 4. Rebuild CISA to Full Capacity
Restore CISA to full staffing. Reinstate election security coordination and threat hunting missions. Rebuild the cybersecurity talent pipeline destroyed by DOGE terminations.

### 5. Restore FEMA and Depoliticize Disaster Aid
Reverse workforce reductions. Reinstate the BRIC pre-disaster mitigation program. Prohibit partisan considerations in disaster aid determinations. Rebuild capacity for climate-driven disaster response.

### 6. Establish Independent ICE Oversight
Create an independent ICE Oversight Board with investigatory and disciplinary authority. Mandate body cameras for all ICE and CBP enforcement operations. Require public reporting of use-of-force incidents and detention deaths.

### 7. Close Abusive Detention Facilities
Close Alligator Alcatraz and all state-operated immigration detention facilities operating outside federal oversight standards. Implement community-based alternatives to detention for non-dangerous individuals.

### 8. Codify DACA Protections
Enact statutory protections for Dreamers and create a pathway to permanent residency for long-term undocumented residents.

## Day One Executive Actions

- Reinstate the sensitive locations policy protecting churches, schools, and hospitals from ICE enforcement
- Restore asylum processing in compliance with federal law, including credible fear interviews
- Renounce invocation of the Alien Enemies Act for immigration matters
- Order immediate review of all ICE detention conditions and halt detention at substandard facilities
- Restore CISA election security and threat hunting missions

## By The Numbers

- **66,000 people:** Record ICE detention population by December 2025 -- highest level in American history
- **23+ deaths:** People who died in ICE custody in fiscal year 2025 -- deadliest year since 2004
- **238 people:** Deported to CECOT in defiance of a federal court order, without notice or hearings
- **1,300 positions:** CISA workforce terminated by DOGE -- nearly 40% of the cybersecurity agency
- **2,000 employees:** Lost from FEMA while climate-driven disasters escalated in severity and frequency
- **261 DACA recipients:** Arrested by ICE between January and November 2025 despite lawful presence
- **36.25% drop:** Reduction in ICE detention facility inspections even as detained population surged

## Key Legislation Proposed

- **Sensitive Locations Protection Act** -- Codifies in statute the prohibition on immigration enforcement at churches, schools, hospitals, and courthouses
- **Asylum System Restoration Act** -- Restores asylum processing in full compliance with the INA and international obligations, including non-refoulement
- **Alien Enemies Act Reform Act** -- Repeals non-wartime applications of the 1798 Act and prohibits its use for immigration enforcement
- **ICE Accountability Act** -- Establishes independent oversight board, mandates body cameras, and requires public reporting of use-of-force and detention deaths
- **DREAM Act** -- Codifies protections for Dreamers and creates a pathway to permanent residency
