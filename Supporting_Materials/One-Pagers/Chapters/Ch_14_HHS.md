# Chapter 14: Department of Health and Human Services -- One-Pager

## What HHS Does

The Department of Health and Human Services is the primary federal agency responsible for protecting the health of all Americans. With a budget exceeding $1.7 trillion, HHS oversees Medicare and Medicaid coverage for more than 140 million Americans, regulates the nation's food and drug supply through the FDA, leads public health surveillance and emergency preparedness through the CDC, funds the National Institutes of Health's biomedical research enterprise, and administers critical programs through HRSA, SAMHSA, and dozens of other constituent agencies. The department touches every dimension of American health: from the safety of the food on American tables to the affordability of insulin, from the integrity of vaccine science to the survival rates of mothers giving birth.

## What Project 2025 Did to HHS

- **Dismantled the CDC:** Cut 2,400 CDC employees, eliminated divisions for infectious disease prevention and immunization programs, collapsed the pandemic preparedness agency (ASPR) back into CDC, censored research on vaccine hesitancy and health disparities, and undermined childhood vaccination confidence -- triggering measles outbreaks in communities with declining vaccination rates.
- **Politicized the FDA:** Launched a politically motivated safety review of mifepristone (used safely by 5+ million women since 2000), cut 3,500 FDA positions (former Commissioner: "The FDA as we've known it is finished"), proposed giving political appointees veto power over scientific drug approval decisions, and weakened dietary supplement oversight.
- **Sabotaged Healthcare Coverage:** Declined to extend enhanced ACA premium tax credits (projected 4.2 million coverage losses), imposed Medicaid work requirements that reduce coverage without increasing employment, proposed Medicaid block grants, eliminated staff responsible for calculating federal poverty guidelines affecting tens of millions, and cut Medicaid enrollment by 3.4 million.
- **Assaulted Reproductive Healthcare:** Froze $65.8 million in Title X family planning grants (preventing an estimated 822,000 unintended pregnancies annually), expanded conscience clause protections to permit patient abandonment, proposed renaming HHS the "Department of Life," weaponized abortion data surveillance, and signaled potential Comstock Act use to block mifepristone shipment nationwide.
- **Gutted NIH Research:** Terminated 5,844 NIH research grants totaling $2.7 billion based on ideological screening -- targeting vaccine research, health disparities, and diversity studies. Proposed cutting NIH by 40%. Halted clinical trials mid-enrollment, placing research participants in medical jeopardy. Issued 24% fewer grants than the prior decade's average.
- **Abandoned Mental Health:** Cut approximately $1 billion from SAMHSA, terminated $88 million in DOJ substance abuse treatment grants, announced non-enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, and abandoned the youth mental health crisis response while 80,000+ Americans died of drug overdoses in 2024.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Restore CDC Scientific Independence
Reinstate all terminated CDC employees. Propose the CDC Independence and Scientific Integrity Act: fixed six-year term for CDC Director (removal only for cause), merit-based scientific advisory committee selection, and prohibition on political alteration of public health guidance. Rebuild immunization, environmental health, and pandemic preparedness infrastructure. Fund 50,000 new public health positions.

### 2. Restore FDA Scientific Integrity
Withdraw the politically motivated mifepristone safety review on Day One. Restore all 3,500 terminated FDA positions. Establish a Senate-confirmed FDA Scientific Integrity Officer. Clarify that the Comstock Act does not prohibit interstate shipment of FDA-approved medications. Strengthen medical device safety by eliminating the 510(k) loophole for high-risk devices.

### 3. Strengthen the ACA and Achieve Universal Coverage
Make enhanced premium tax credits permanent (21.4 million enrollees depend on them). Create a federal public option at 110% of Medicare rates available on all marketplaces. Close the Medicaid coverage gap for 1.9 million Americans in non-expansion states through a direct federal fallback program. Reduce the uninsured rate from 8% to below 4%.

### 4. Expand Medicare Benefits
Add dental, vision, and hearing coverage for 65 million beneficiaries (68% currently lack dental insurance). Expand drug price negotiation from 10 to 50 drugs, with first-round savings of 38-79% on targeted medications for 9 million beneficiaries. Establish a federal long-term care benefit with living wage requirements for care workers.

### 5. Protect and Expand Reproductive Healthcare
Restore all Title X funding and increase to $750 million over four years. Propose the Medication Abortion Access Act preempting state telehealth and mail restrictions. Enforce EMTALA's emergency obstetric care requirement regardless of state abortion laws. Reform conscience clauses to prevent patient abandonment in emergencies. Expand OTC contraception access.

### 6. Rebuild NIH Research Capacity
Reinstate all 5,844 terminated grants. Increase NIH funding by 20% annually to reach $77 billion by year four. Codify that grant decisions are made exclusively through peer review under 42 U.S.C. Section 289. Protect NIH institute directors with fixed five-year terms. Expand health disparities research through NIMHD.

### 7. Eliminate the Black Maternal Mortality Crisis
Implement the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act: mandatory 12-month postpartum Medicaid coverage in all states, community-based doula programs (10,000 trained doulas in underserved communities), mandatory implicit bias training for all federally funded obstetric providers, and rural maternal care infrastructure grants. Reduce Black maternal mortality from 50.3 to below 25 per 100,000 live births.

### 8. Mental Health Parity and Substance Use Treatment
Resume full MHPAEA enforcement on Day One with civil penalties up to $100/day per affected beneficiary. Restore $1 billion in SAMHSA funding plus $2 billion in new annual appropriations. Expand opioid treatment to 2,000 new sites nationally. Declare youth mental health a national emergency. Fund 50,000 school-based mental health counselors.
