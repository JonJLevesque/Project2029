# Chapter 17: Department of Justice -- One-Pager

## What the Department of Justice Does

The Department of Justice is the federal government's chief law enforcement agency, charged with ensuring equal justice under law, enforcing civil rights, prosecuting federal crimes, and defending the constitutional rights of all Americans. Its components include the Civil Rights Division, the Public Integrity Section, the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, and 93 United States Attorney offices.

When functioning as intended, the DOJ operates independently from political interference, applying the same legal standards to all persons regardless of political affiliation. The rule of law depends on this independence: no one is above the law, including presidents.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Department of Justice

- **Weaponized Prosecutorial Power:** Opened investigations of political opponents including Sen. Adam Schiff, Chris Krebs, and George Soros, while indicting former FBI Director James Comey and NY AG Letitia James on charges career prosecutors deemed insufficient. A U.S. Attorney was fired for refusing to bring politically motivated cases.
- **Gutted the Civil Rights Division:** 75 percent of Civil Rights Division attorneys departed (250+ attorneys). The Voting Section was reduced from approximately 30 career attorneys to just 3. Eight voting rights lawsuits were dismissed without rationale.
- **Fired All January 6 Prosecutors:** Terminated with written letters explicitly stating they were fired for prosecuting January 6 cases, calling it a "grave national injustice."
- **Eliminated Public Integrity Enforcement:** Fired nearly all Public Integrity Unit attorneys, destroying the government's capacity to prosecute corruption regardless of party.
- **Sent Threatening Letters to Congress:** Official DOJ letters were sent to members of Congress for protected political speech, using the department as an instrument of political intimidation.
- **Expanded Private Prisons:** Reversed Biden-era orders ending federal private prison contracts, enriching CoreCivic and GEO Group while perpetuating a system that profits from mass incarceration.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Establish DOJ Structural Independence
Enact the Department of Justice Independence Act establishing a 10-year fixed term for the Attorney General with cause-only removal, 60-vote Senate confirmation, and criminal penalties for improper White House interference in prosecutorial decisions. Modeled on the FBI Director's fixed term, this structural reform ensures no future president can weaponize the Department of Justice against political opponents.

### 2. End Political Prosecutions Immediately
Day One executive order reviewing all ongoing investigations for political taint, dismissing cases lacking merit or proper predication, and restoring dropped investigations of genuine wrongdoing. Prohibit consideration of political affiliation in all prosecutorial decisions. Restore Special Counsel independence and Inspector General authority.

### 3. Rebuild the Civil Rights Division
Restore Civil Rights Division priorities across voting rights, police misconduct, fair housing, LGBTQ+ rights, and reproductive rights. Resume Section 2 Voting Rights Act enforcement nationwide and reopen pattern-or-practice police misconduct investigations with enforceable consent decrees. Hire to restore the Division to full strength, reversing the 75 percent departure of attorneys.

### 4. Create a Campaign Finance Enforcement Unit
Dedicate 50 DOJ attorneys to campaign finance violations, coordinate with a restructured FEC, and prioritize prosecution of foreign money, dark money, Super PAC coordination, and disclosure violations. Establish criminal prosecution standards for knowing and willful campaign finance violations and coordinate with FBI white-collar crime units and FinCEN for money laundering investigations.

### 5. Abolish Private Prisons
Issue a Day One executive order ending all federal private prison contracts, covering Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Marshals Service, and ICE detention. Enact the Private Prison Prohibition Act permanently banning federal contracting with private prisons and conditioning Byrne JAG grants on state elimination of private detention. Phase out private immigration detention by reducing detention population 75 percent through community-based Alternatives to Detention, which achieve 99 percent appearance rates at one-tenth the cost.

### 6. Eliminate Cash Bail in the Federal System
Direct DOJ to implement pretrial reform, replacing wealth-based detention with risk-based release standards. Currently, 470,000 legally innocent people sit in jail because they cannot afford bail, and 74 percent of the jail population is pretrial -- legally innocent but detained solely because of poverty. Enact federal legislation prohibiting cash bail and conditioning federal grants on state reform.

### 7. Enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act
Conduct comprehensive FARA compliance reviews of all organizations lobbying for foreign government interests, including AIPAC and an estimated 40 to 60 similar organizations currently operating as domestic entities while coordinating with foreign governments. Issue formal compliance inquiry letters within the first 90 days and pursue civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance.

### 8. Transform Criminal Justice
Pursue sentencing reform eliminating mandatory minimums for non-violent offenses. Abolish the federal death penalty. Codify and expand clemency processes. Fund reentry programs and support the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act to restore workers' access to the courts.
