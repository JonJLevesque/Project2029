# Chapter 11: Department of Education -- One-Pager

## What the Department of Education Does

The Department of Education administers federal education policy, distributes funding to schools and universities, enforces civil rights in education, and supports research on teaching and learning. It oversees Title I funding for high-poverty schools, IDEA funding for students with disabilities, Pell Grants for college students, and federal student loan programs serving over 44 million borrowers with $1.7 trillion in outstanding debt. An informed, critically thinking citizenry is democracy's best defense against authoritarianism.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Department of Education

- **Attempted Elimination:** Project 2025 planned to abolish the Department of Education entirely, eliminating federal oversight of educational equity and civil rights enforcement in schools serving 50 million students.
- **Gutted Civic Education:** Eliminated civics and history programs, politicized AP courses, and imposed "divisive concepts" laws that restricted accurate teaching of American history. Critical thinking was discouraged and media literacy programs were eliminated.
- **Defunded Public Schools:** Cut Title I and IDEA funding while promoting privatization through voucher schemes that diverted public funds to private and religious schools with no accountability for outcomes.
- **Attacked Academic Freedom:** Fueled a record wave of book banning (4,000+ challenges in 2022-23), teacher intimidation through surveillance "tip lines," and hostile school board takeovers. Twenty-plus states passed laws restricting teaching about race, gender, and history.
- **Undermined Higher Education:** Blocked student loan forgiveness programs, allowed predatory for-profit colleges to exploit veterans and low-income students, and froze progress on college affordability while tuition continued to outpace inflation.
- **Criminalized Students:** Maintained the school-to-prison pipeline -- 14 million students attend schools with police but no counselors, with Black students 3x more likely to be suspended than white students.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Civic Education Initiative ($5 Billion Annually)
A comprehensive investment in civic literacy, critical thinking, and media literacy education at every grade level. Includes K-12 civic education standards, iCivics expansion, digital literacy training, and age-appropriate civic engagement programs. Students will learn to identify misinformation, evaluate sources, understand how government works, and engage constructively in democratic discourse.

### 2. Free Public Higher Education ($80 Billion Federal Share Annually)
Tuition-free public higher education for families earning under $125,000 and free community college for all students regardless of income. Living expenses covered for lowest-income students. Funded through a federal-state partnership with phased implementation: community college free in Year 1, full program by Year 3. Legal basis: Spending Clause, modeled on the GI Bill.

### 3. Student Debt Cancellation and Reform
Broad-based cancellation of $10,000-$50,000 per borrower (income-scaled), with full cancellation for Pell Grant recipients, borrowers defrauded by for-profit colleges, and those in repayment for 20+ years. Simplified single-plan income-based repayment at 10% of discretionary income with tax-free forgiveness after 20 years (10 years for public service). Legal basis: Higher Education Act Section 432(a).

### 4. Teacher Compensation Revolution ($10 Billion Annually)
Federal incentive structure targeting an $80,000 minimum teacher salary nationwide, with 50% federal matching of the cost to reach the target from current levels. Includes accelerated 5-year loan forgiveness for teachers in Title I schools, housing assistance programs, and Grow Your Own recruitment pipelines to diversify the teaching workforce.

### 5. Academic Freedom Protection Act
Federal legislation preempting state "divisive concepts" laws, prohibiting book banning based on viewpoint, and establishing a $100 million annual Teacher Legal Defense Fund. Schools receiving federal funds must maintain academic freedom. Legal basis: First Amendment (Tinker v. Des Moines, Keyishian v. Board of Regents) and Spending Clause.

### 6. School-to-Prison Pipeline Dismantling
Condition federal funding on removing School Resource Officers (with documented exceptions), redirect funding to counselors and social workers, and invest in restorative justice programs. Target: 1 counselor per 250 students (current ratio: 1 per 500+). Reduce suspensions 50%, eliminate racial disparities in discipline, and reduce school arrests 75%.

### 7. Anti-Privatization Measures
Prohibit federal funds for voucher programs diverting money to private schools. Require charter schools receiving public funds to meet the same accountability standards as public schools: financial transparency, non-discrimination, special education compliance, and teacher certification. Crack down on predatory for-profit colleges through restored gainful employment rules and 90/10 rule enforcement.

### 8. Media Literacy for Democracy ($2 Billion Annually)
Dedicated funding for teaching students to navigate digital information ecosystems, recognize misinformation and propaganda, evaluate source credibility, and understand how algorithms shape the information they consume. Includes the CRAAP test (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose), lateral reading techniques, and deepfake identification.
