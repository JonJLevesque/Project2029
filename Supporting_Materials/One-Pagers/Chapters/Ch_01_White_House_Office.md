# Chapter 1: White House Office -- One-Pager

## What the White House Office Does

The White House Office (WHO) is the nerve center of executive branch governance, comprising the President's closest advisers and the staff who implement the presidential agenda daily. It includes the Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO), White House Counsel, the National Security Council staff, the Domestic Policy Council, the National Economic Council, the Office of Legislative Affairs, and the Office of Communications. When functioning professionally, the WHO ensures that presidential decisions are informed by expertise, constrained by law, and accountable to the public.

## What Project 2025 Did to the White House Office

- **Weaponized the Office of Presidential Personnel:** Project 2025 directed PPO to conduct "political background checks" and fill approximately 4,000 positions with "dedicated conservatives," replacing merit-based hiring with ideological loyalty tests (Project 2025, p. 31-32).
- **Imposed Schedule F Political Purges:** The blueprint explicitly called for "developing plans (for example, Schedule F)" to reclassify career professionals, stripping civil service protections from tens of thousands of positions (Project 2025, p. 32).
- **Subordinated White House Counsel:** Rather than serving as an independent legal guardian, Counsel was directed to provide "zealous representation" focused on how to "pursue and realize the President's agenda" -- transforming legal compliance into political enablement (Project 2025, p. 26-27).
- **Concentrated Power in Loyalists:** All decision-making authority was centralized in political appointees, with career professionals explicitly subordinated or removed. The doctrine that "personnel is policy" was weaponized to justify patronage (Project 2025, p. 31).
- **Eliminated Transparency:** No provision was made for public accountability, visitor logs, ethics waivers, or mechanisms for external oversight.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Restore Merit-Based Staffing
Day One Executive Order rescinds all political loyalty requirements, Schedule F classifications, and ideological vetting. All WHO positions below Assistant to the President level must be filled based on professional qualifications, not political conformity.

### 2. Transform the Office of Presidential Personnel
Convert PPO from a patronage operation into a professional human resources function. Require a Chief Human Resources Officer with professional HR credentials. End political background checks for career positions.

### 3. Restore White House Counsel Independence
Reestablish the Office of White House Counsel as an independent legal guardian of lawful conduct. Counsel must halt any activity that violates federal law -- not find ways around legal limits.

### 4. Establish Comprehensive Ethics Standards
Require mandatory ethics training within 14 days of appointment, public financial disclosures for all staff at GS-13 and above, and creation of an independent Ethics Compliance Office with enforcement authority.

### 5. Restore Transparency and Accountability
Publish organizational charts, senior staff calendars, White House visitor logs, and ethics waivers. Respond to FOIA requests within statutory timelines.

### 6. Professionalize Policy Councils
Integrate career professionals with relevant expertise into the National Security Council, Domestic Policy Council, and National Economic Council. Require candid professional analysis including dissenting views.

### 7. Protect Whistleblowers
Prohibit retaliation against any WHO employee for reporting legal or ethical violations, refusing to participate in unlawful conduct, or providing candid professional advice.

## Day One Executive Actions

- Issue Executive Order restoring merit-based White House Office staffing and rescinding all political loyalty requirements
- Issue Executive Order restoring ethics and transparency standards, including visitor logs and financial disclosure
- Issue Executive Order professionalizing policy development with evidence-based requirements
- Halt all PPO political background checks and ideological vetting immediately
- Suspend all Schedule F classifications pending audit and restoration of civil service protections

## By The Numbers

- **4,000 positions:** Number Project 2025 directed PPO to fill with "dedicated conservatives" based on political loyalty, not qualifications
- **50,000+ positions:** Targeted for Schedule F reclassification, stripping civil service protections
- **1,200:** Proposed cap on political appointees under Project 2029 reforms (down from 4,000)
- **14 days:** Timeline for mandatory ethics training for all WHO staff under restoration framework

## Key Legislation Proposed

- **White House Staffing Standards Act** -- Codifies merit-based hiring requirements for WHO positions and prohibits political purges with criminal penalties
- **White House Ethics and Transparency Act** -- Establishes statutory financial disclosure, visitor log publication, and independent Ethics Compliance Office with enforcement authority
- **Presidential Personnel Reform Act** -- Caps political appointees at 1,200, requires professional HR standards, and mandates annual GAO audits of PPO hiring practices
