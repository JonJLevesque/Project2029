# Chapter 21: Department of Commerce -- One-Pager

## What the Department of Commerce Does

The Department of Commerce is the federal government's primary instrument for economic stewardship, scientific infrastructure, and global competitiveness. Its eleven bureaus and 40,000+ employees operate the Census Bureau (demographic data underpinning congressional apportionment and every federal formula grant), NOAA and the National Weather Service (weather forecasting, climate monitoring, satellite networks, and fisheries management), NIST (measurement standards and the AI Safety Institute), the Bureau of Industry and Security (export controls on advanced semiconductors and AI hardware), NTIA (broadband deployment and the $42.5 billion BEAD program), the Minority Business Development Agency (support for minority entrepreneurs), the Economic Development Administration (regional economic recovery grants), the International Trade Administration (export promotion), the Bureau of Economic Analysis (GDP and national accounts), and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These are not peripheral bureaucratic functions -- they are the measurement, forecast, and infrastructure systems on which a modern economy depends.

## What Project 2025 Did to Commerce

- **Dismantled NOAA and the Weather Service:** Proposed breaking NOAA into subagencies, commercializing National Weather Service forecasting, canceling the GeoXO satellite constellation, and cutting forecast office staffing -- threatening accurate severe weather warnings for every American.
- **Gutted the AI Safety Institute:** Rebranded NIST's AI Safety Institute, stripped its voluntary evaluation authority, and redirected its mission from safety to deregulation -- leaving frontier AI development without federal safety oversight.
- **Sabotaged Broadband Deployment:** Froze the BEAD program, rescinded state conditional approvals, eliminated the fiber deployment preference, and delayed billions in broadband funding that would connect millions of unserved Americans.
- **Eliminated the Minority Business Development Agency:** Targeted MBDA for elimination, fired staff, closed business centers, and ended capital facilitation programs that supported minority entrepreneurs across the country.
- **Undermined Census Independence:** Proposed political interference in Census methodology, threatened survey continuity, and sought to add citizenship questions to suppress participation by immigrant communities.
- **Weakened Export Controls:** Proposed reducing Bureau of Industry and Security staffing and enforcement capacity at exactly the moment China is intensifying efforts to acquire advanced semiconductor and AI technology.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. NOAA and Weather Service Full Restoration
Restore all NWS forecast offices to 24/7 operations within 90 days, fill every vacancy created by DOGE-era cuts, restore the GeoXO satellite constellation to full original specification, and establish statutory minimum staffing levels tied to geographic coverage area and population served. Require Senate confirmation for the NOAA Administrator with qualifications in atmospheric science or oceanography.

### 2. AI Safety Institute Permanent Authorization
Reestablish the AI Safety Institute at NIST with permanent statutory authority, a $300 million annual appropriation, and authority to require pre-deployment safety evaluations for high-risk AI systems above defined capability thresholds.

### 3. BEAD Broadband Program Completion
Reinstate all frozen state approvals, restore the fiber deployment preference, resume funding distribution, and set a binding statutory deadline of December 31, 2028 for all BEAD-funded broadband infrastructure to be operational.

### 4. Minority Business Development Agency Expansion
Reopen all closed MBDA business centers, expand the network by 30 new locations, create an MBDA Capital Access Program targeting $500 million in guaranteed loans annually, and establish a Federal Minority Business Contracting Office.

### 5. Census Independence and Statistical Integrity
Codify Census Bureau independence from political interference, restore all terminated surveys and advisory committees, prohibit suppression of statistical releases, and establish a Federal Statistical Independence Board.

### 6. Semiconductor Export Control Enforcement
Hire 200 additional BIS enforcement staff, implement mandatory end-user verification for advanced semiconductor exports, close transshipment loopholes, and initiate Wassenaar Arrangement modernization with allied nations.

### 7. CHIPS Act Full Implementation
Restore the CHIPS Program Office to full staffing, complete all manufacturing incentive agreements for funded facilities, and ensure domestic semiconductor fabrication construction starts are underway for the first tranche of projects. Publish a final National Semiconductor Strategy within 12 months.

### 8. Economic Development and Patent Office Restoration
Restore the Economic Development Administration to full staffing and funding, launch an EDA Just Transition program with $500 million in first awards for communities affected by energy transition, prohibit USPTO fee diversion by statute, and reduce patent application average pendency to under 20 months.

### 9. Spectrum and Telecommunications Modernization
Complete a Federal Spectrum Efficiency Review within 12 months, reauthorize FCC spectrum auction authority, implement commercial sharing arrangements for underutilized federal bands, and fund U.S. representation at 6G standards bodies to maintain American leadership in next-generation telecommunications.

## Day One Executive Actions

- Direct BIS to publish a comprehensive emerging technology export control review within 90 days
- Restore 24/7 NWS forecast office operations at all offices nationwide within 90 days

## By The Numbers

- **$42.5 billion:** BEAD broadband program funding frozen or delayed by Project 2025
- **40,000+ employees:** Commerce Department workforce targeted for cuts
- **30 forecast offices:** Lost their lead meteorologists under DOGE-era staffing reductions
- **$1.5 billion annually:** MBDA capital facilitation capacity destroyed by agency elimination
- **200 new BIS staff:** Needed to enforce semiconductor export controls against Chinese acquisition
- **$300 million:** Proposed annual appropriation for the AI Safety Institute at NIST
- **$500 million:** Target for annual MBDA guaranteed lending once Capital Access Program is operational
- **December 31, 2028:** Proposed binding statutory deadline for all BEAD-funded broadband to be in service
- **10:1:** Target private investment leverage ratio for EDA rural community investments

## Key Legislation Proposed

- **Weather Service Workforce Protection and Independence Act** -- Establish statutory minimum NWS staffing levels and protect forecast offices from future across-the-board cuts
- **AI Safety and Standards Act** -- Permanently authorize the AI Safety Institute at NIST with mandatory $300M annual funding and pre-deployment evaluation authority
- **Census Independence and Statistical Integrity Act** -- Codify Census Bureau independence and prohibit political interference in federal statistical data
- **Broadband Access Completion Act** -- Set binding 2028 completion deadline for BEAD and create enforcement mechanisms for state non-performance
- **MBDA Expansion and Minority Business Access Act** -- Expand MBDA funding by 50%, authorize 30 new business centers, and create MBDA Capital Access Program
- **Semiconductor Supply Chain Security Act** -- Strengthen export controls, close transshipment loopholes, and fund 200 additional BIS enforcement staff
