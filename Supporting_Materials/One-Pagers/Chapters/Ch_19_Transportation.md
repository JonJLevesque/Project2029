# Chapter 19: Department of Transportation -- One-Pager

## What the Department of Transportation Does

The Department of Transportation (DOT) oversees the movement of people and goods across the United States through nineteen operating administrations, including the FAA, Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Amtrak, NHTSA, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.

The department administers approximately $120 billion annually in infrastructure investment, manages safety regulation across all transportation modes, and oversees infrastructure used by hundreds of millions of Americans daily -- the Interstate Highway System's 47,000 miles, approximately 45,000 daily flights through the national airspace system, and freight rail corridors carrying 40 percent of all U.S. freight ton-miles. Transportation infrastructure is the circulatory system of the American economy.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Department of Transportation

- **Gutted Aviation Safety After a Fatal Disaster:** Weeks after the January 29, 2025 midair collision near Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people amid documented ATC understaffing, the administration fired approximately 400 FAA employees through DOGE, including safety-critical support staff. The FAA remains short 3,500 air traffic controllers, with only 23 of 289 facilities meeting full staffing targets.
- **Froze $5 Billion in EV Charging Funds:** Froze all NEVI program disbursements in violation of the Impoundment Control Act, delaying a nationwide EV charging network by years. The GAO confirmed the freeze constituted an unlawful impoundment.
- **Defunded Amtrak and Intercity Rail:** Proposed cutting Northeast Corridor funding by 25 percent, pulled federal funding from the Dallas-Houston high-speed rail project, and pushed privatization of the national rail network. Amtrak's CEO resigned amid funding threats.
- **Proposed Eliminating Transit Funding:** Proposed eliminating the $4.2 billion Capital Investment Grants program and core FTA formula funding, threatening bus and rail service for tens of millions of Americans, including rural and low-income communities where federal funds cover more than 70 percent of transit capital costs.
- **Deregulated Trucking Safety:** Implemented the "Pro-Trucker Package" weakening hours-of-service protections, canceled truck speed limiter mandates, and reduced FMCSA enforcement case initiations by approximately 60 percent. Large truck crashes kill approximately 5,000 Americans per year.
- **Eliminated Airline Passenger Rights:** Moved to rescind Biden-era rules requiring automatic cash refunds, banning hidden fees, and mandating family seating without surcharges, restoring the airline industry's ability to impose junk fees on approximately 900 million domestic passengers annually.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Restore FAA Safety Workforce
Hire 1,800 new air traffic controller trainees per year for five years through the Aviation Safety Workforce Act. Reinstate all wrongfully terminated FAA employees. Establish a $3 billion ATC Workforce Emergency Fund and require all facilities to reach 90 percent of recommended staffing within four years. Restructure the FAA Aircraft Certification Office to fully separate safety certification from industry relationship management, addressing the structural failure that enabled the 737 MAX disasters.

### 2. Complete the NEVI EV Charging Network
Obligate all remaining $5 billion in NEVI appropriations within 90 days. Deploy 20,000 new public fast-charging ports within two years, prioritizing rural and underserved corridors. Fund 50,000 electric school buses in Environmental Justice communities through the Public Transit Investment and Equity Act.

### 3. Build a National High-Speed Rail Network
Establish a National High-Speed Rail Authority with $50 billion over 10 years and 80 percent federal cost-share. Restore Amtrak's full Northeast Corridor capital allocation of $1.14 billion. Restore Dallas-Houston high-speed rail federal funding. Designate initial corridors for the Northeast Corridor, Dallas-Houston, and Chicago-Midwest. Execute the Gateway Program Hudson River tunnels full-funding grant agreement.

### 4. Restore and Expand Transit Funding
Reinstate the Capital Investment Grants program and expand it to $6 billion annually. Create a $2 billion annual Rural Transit Emergency Fund, recognizing that federal funds cover more than 70 percent of capital costs for small urban and rural transit systems. Establish Complete Streets policy as a condition of all federal highway funding, requiring safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.

### 5. Enact the Railway Safety Act
Mandate electronically controlled pneumatic brakes on all trains carrying Class 1 hazardous materials, require wayside detection systems at 25-mile intervals on hazmat corridors, and mandate minimum two-person crews on hazmat trains and trains operating above 50 mph. These are the reforms demanded by the 2023 East Palestine, Ohio derailment that the rail industry has lobbied to block.

### 6. Establish an Autonomous Vehicle Safety Framework
Require pre-deployment safety certification for Level 4 and Level 5 systems through the Autonomous Vehicle Safety Act. Mandate real-time crash and disengagement reporting, require third-party safety audits, and create manufacturer liability for autonomous driving system failures. Create an AV Safety Database administered by NHTSA. Establish civil penalties of up to $500 million for safety data fraud.

### 7. Restore Trucking Safety
Reinstate hours-of-service safety floors by rescinding the "Pro-Trucker Package" on Day One. Finalize truck speed limiter mandates projected to save hundreds of lives annually. Restore FMCSA enforcement to pre-Trump levels, reversing the 60 percent drop in case initiations that has left dangerous carriers on the road with impunity.

### 8. Codify Airline Passenger Rights
Enact the Airline Passenger Rights and Fair Aviation Competition Act mandating automatic cash refunds for canceled flights and delays exceeding two hours, banning hidden fees, requiring competitor rebooking for significant delays, and guaranteeing family seating without surcharges. Establish a Passenger Rights Ombudsman within DOT with independent investigative authority.

## Day One Executive Actions
