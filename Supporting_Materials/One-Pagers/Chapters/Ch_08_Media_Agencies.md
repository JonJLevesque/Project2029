# Chapter 8: Federal Media and Communications Agencies -- One-Pager

## What These Agencies Do

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), and the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) collectively constitute the institutional infrastructure of American democratic discourse. The FCC licenses the broadcast spectrum that every television and radio station depends upon. CPB funds public broadcasting -- PBS and NPR -- that reaches every corner of the country, including rural and underserved communities with no viable commercial alternative. USAGM operates Voice of America and affiliated networks that project American democratic values -- honest journalism, press freedom, and factual reporting -- to authoritarian audiences across the globe. These agencies are not peripheral bureaucracies; they are the communications backbone of a self-governing republic.

## What Project 2025 Did to Media Agencies

- **Weaponized FCC Licensing Against the Press:** Chairman Brendan Carr -- the primary author of Project 2025's FCC chapter -- used the agency's licensing and merger review powers as instruments of political coercion. He threatened broadcast licenses of networks that covered the administration critically, opened investigations against ABC, NBC, and CBS, and conditioned merger approvals on political settlements. Trump publicly demanded on Truth Social that ABC and NBC lose their licenses for "unfair coverage."

- **Destroyed Public Broadcasting:** President Trump signed Executive Order 14290, "Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media," directing CPB to cease funding PBS and NPR. Congress rescinded $1.1 billion in CPB appropriations, forcing the organization to announce its dissolution. Tens of millions of Americans -- particularly in rural areas and underserved communities -- lost access to their primary source of local and educational programming.

- **Gutted Voice of America:** Kari Lake was installed at USAGM over legal objection. She slashed staff from 1,300 to fewer than 100 employees, eliminated service in dozens of languages, partnered with One America News Network to provide propaganda content, and appeared on VOA's own Persian-language service to deliver pro-Trump promotional content -- in direct violation of the editorial firewall required by federal law (22 U.S.C. 6202(b)).

- **Killed Net Neutrality and Media Ownership Rules:** The FCC eliminated net neutrality protections and launched the "Delete, Delete, Delete" proceeding to eliminate media ownership rules. The result: accelerating monopolization of broadcast markets, ISP throttling without oversight, and further consolidation of local news into fewer corporate hands.

- **Attacked Press Freedom at Its Foundation:** The administration used the full weight of federal regulatory authority -- licensing, mergers, spectrum management -- to punish media outlets for editorial independence. This was not regulation; it was the deployment of government power to silence critical journalism.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Restore and Triple Public Broadcasting Funding
Re-establish CPB, PBS, and NPR with $1.5 billion in annual federal funding -- triple the previous level. Authorize funding for 10 years with statutory firewalls preventing executive defunding by order. Establish a $500 million Local Journalism Preservation Fund and a $200 million Investigative Journalism Fund within CPB. Mandate full digital accessibility for all CPB-funded content.

### 2. Rebuild Voice of America and USAGM
Restore USAGM workforce to 1,000+ professional staff and all 49 language services. Enforce the editorial firewall under 22 U.S.C. 6202(b). Remove all OAN content from USAGM networks within 30 days. Enact the USAGM Permanent Independence Act prohibiting appointment of political operatives to USAGM leadership and requiring annual independent firewall compliance audits.

### 3. Codify Net Neutrality in Statute
Enact the Open Internet Act permanently classifying broadband as a Title II telecommunications service. Prohibit ISP blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and anti-competitive zero-rating. Restore FCC broadband consumer privacy rules with opt-in consent requirements. Establish a private right of action for injured consumers.

### 4. Protect FCC Independence from Political Weaponization
Enact the FCC Independence and Anti-Retaliation Act requiring a four-of-five commissioner supermajority before initiating any license revocation proceeding against a national broadcast network. Require independent ALJ review of content-based license challenges. Impose personal liability on commissioners whose proceedings are found motivated by viewpoint discrimination.

### 5. Reverse Media Concentration
Restore media ownership rules eliminated under the "Delete, Delete, Delete" proceeding through lawful notice-and-comment rulemaking. Enact the Local News Ownership Diversity Act restoring cross-ownership prohibitions and creating tax incentives for transfer of local media properties to employee-owned cooperatives or community foundations.

### 6. Reform Section 230 Narrowly
Extend Section 230(c)(1) immunity to good-faith content moderation decisions. Create a narrow exception for platforms knowingly amplifying coordinated inauthentic behavior. Require transparency reports from large platforms. Preserve full immunity for all other third-party speech hosting.

### 7. Establish Universal Broadband Access
Enact Broadband Universal Service Program legislation providing subsidized broadband service to low-income households. Target median broadband speeds in rural census tracts to increase by at least 50% within four years.

## Day One Executive Actions
