# Chapter 3: Central Personnel Agencies -- One-Pager

## What the Central Personnel Agencies Do

The federal civil service is the constitutional foundation of accountable, professional governance. Three central personnel agencies safeguard it: the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which administers merit-based hiring and workforce management for 2.1 million federal employees; the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which adjudicates employee appeals and protects against prohibited personnel practices; and the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), which coordinates independent oversight across all federal agencies. Together, these institutions ensure that the federal workforce serves the public interest based on merit, not political loyalty.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Personnel Agencies

- **Implemented Schedule F Political Purges:** Created the Schedule F classification to strip civil service protections from 50,000+ policy-influencing positions, allowing at-will firing and replacement with political loyalists. Violated 5 U.S.C. SS 2302(b)(6) (discrimination based on political affiliation).
- **Weaponized OPM:** Transformed OPM from guardian of merit principles into an implementation arm of White House political purges. Conducted ideological screening, imposed political loyalty interviews, and maintained political blacklists of career employees.
- **Fired 17 Inspectors General Overnight:** The "Friday Night Massacre" of January 24-25, 2025 -- 17 IGs fired via two-sentence email without the 30-day congressional notice required by the Inspector General Act. Federal court ruled the firings "unlawfully conducted" (September 2025).
- **Destroyed MSPB Adjudication:** Deliberately maintained board vacancies for 28 months (December 2019 to March 2022), creating a backlog of 3,000+ unadjudicated employee appeals and eliminating the judicial mechanism protecting career civil servants from political retaliation.
- **Defunded CIGIE Oversight:** OMB withheld funds from CIGIE, taking 15+ oversight websites offline, making 34,000+ investigative reports inaccessible, and shutting down whistleblower hotlines.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Rescind Schedule F and Restore Civil Service Protections
Day One Executive Order eliminates all Schedule F classifications, restores civil service protections to all affected positions, and offers immediate reinstatement with full back pay to all wrongfully terminated employees.

### 2. Rebuild OPM as Guardian of the Merit System
Replace political OPM leadership. Require Senate confirmation for OPM Director with professional qualifications. Statutorily prohibit White House political office involvement in merit-based personnel decisions.

### 3. Reinstate Inspectors General and Rebuild Oversight
Reinstate all wrongfully fired IGs. Establish independent funding for IG offices immune from OMB withholding. Create criminal penalties for violating IG removal requirements and automatic court review of IG firings.

### 4. Restore MSPB to Full Function
Appoint qualified, non-partisan board members. Expedite adjudication of 3,000+ backlogged appeals. Mandate full 3-member board composition at all times with automatic appointment mechanisms to prevent vacancy manipulation.

### 5. Codify Civil Service Protections in Statute
Enact legislation prohibiting mass reclassifications without congressional approval. Create criminal penalties (5-10 years) for political interference in merit-based personnel decisions. Establish automatic judicial review of mass terminations.

### 6. Strengthen Whistleblower Protections
Enhance protections with enforcement mechanisms. Criminalize retaliation against employees who report political interference. Restore all whistleblower hotlines and reporting channels.

## Day One Executive Actions

- Rescind all Schedule F classifications and restore civil service protections
- Begin immediate review of all terminations since January 2025
- Reinstate wrongfully terminated employees with back pay and restored benefits
- Eliminate all political loyalty tests and restore merit-based hiring
- Restore fired Inspectors General and rebuild oversight infrastructure

## By The Numbers

- **50,000+ positions:** Targeted for Schedule F reclassification, stripping civil service protections
- **17 Inspectors General:** Fired in the "Friday Night Massacre" without legally required notice
- **3,000+ appeals:** Backlogged at MSPB during deliberately maintained board vacancy
- **28 months:** Duration MSPB was non-functional due to strategic vacancy manipulation
- **34,000+ reports:** Investigative reports made inaccessible when OMB defunded CIGIE
- **5 IGs:** Were investigating Elon Musk companies (SpaceX, Neuralink, Tesla) at time of firing

## Key Legislation Proposed

- **Civil Service Protection Act** -- Codifies merit system protections in statute with criminal penalties for violations
- **Anti-Schedule F Act** -- Permanently prohibits mass reclassification of career positions to remove civil service protections
- **Whistleblower Enhancement Act** -- Strengthens protections with enforcement mechanisms and treble damages
- **MSPB Restoration Act** -- Mandates full board composition, expedited confirmation, and expanded jurisdiction
- **Federal Workforce Investment Act** -- Rebuilds federal workforce capacity through competitive compensation and professional development
