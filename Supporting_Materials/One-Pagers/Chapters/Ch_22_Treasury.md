# Chapter 22: Department of the Treasury -- One-Pager

## What the Treasury Department Does

The Treasury Department is the engine of federal fiscal policy, responsible for tax collection, economic policy, financial regulation, and managing the national debt. Through the IRS, it collects federal revenue; through FinCEN, it combats money laundering and financial crime; and through its regulatory authority under the Internal Revenue Code, it shapes the tax system that determines who pays and who profits. The 16th Amendment grants Congress unlimited power to tax income "from whatever source derived." Treasury policy determines whether the tax system serves working families or entrenches billionaire dynasties.

## What Project 2025 Did to Treasury

- **Extended Billionaire Tax Cuts:** Made the 2017 TCJA corporate rate (21%) permanent, extended individual rate cuts for the highest brackets, and preserved the estate tax exemption at $13.6 million -- ensuring dynastic wealth transfer continues untaxed.
- **Gutted IRS Enforcement:** Cancelled 87,000 IRS agent hirings authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act, redirected funding away from high-income enforcement, and reduced audit rates for millionaires to near-zero.
- **Expanded Tax Loopholes:** Protected the carried interest loophole, expanded opportunity zones benefiting wealthy investors, weakened FATCA enforcement against offshore tax evasion, and delayed beneficial ownership transparency rules.
- **Preserved "Buy, Borrow, Die":** Left intact the strategy that allows billionaires to accumulate wealth tax-free by never selling assets, borrowing against them for spending, and passing them to heirs with stepped-up basis -- erasing all unrealized gains at death.
- **Widened the Tax Gap:** The $600+ billion annual gap between taxes owed and taxes collected continued to grow, with 70%+ attributable to wealthy individuals and corporations exploiting enforcement weakness.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Billionaire Minimum Tax (30-35%)
End the "buy, borrow, die" strategy by imposing a 30-35% minimum tax on Total Economic Income for individuals with $100 million+ in net worth. Tax unrealized gains on liquid assets using mark-to-market valuation. Estimated revenue: $25-40 billion annually.

### 2. Wealth Tax
Impose a 2% annual tax on fortunes over $50 million and 3% on fortunes over $1 billion. This single reform generates an estimated $300 billion annually -- enough to fund universal healthcare or free public higher education.

### 3. Capital Gains Equality
Tax investment income at the same rate as wages. End the preferential treatment that lets billionaires pay lower effective rates than nurses, teachers, and firefighters. Estimated revenue: $20 billion annually.

### 4. Corporate Tax Reform
Restore the corporate rate to 28%, strengthen GILTI provisions with 15% country-by-country minimums, increase the stock buyback tax from 1% to 4%, and close loopholes. Estimated revenue: $150 billion annually.

### 5. IRS Enforcement Surge
Invest $80 billion over 10 years, hire 50,000+ new IRS personnel, target 8% audit rates for millionaires and 15% for those earning $10M+. Estimated enforcement revenue: $20 billion annually plus reducing the $600 billion tax gap.

### 6. Offshore Tax Haven Crackdown
Aggressive FATCA enforcement, accelerated Corporate Transparency Act implementation, beneficial ownership disclosure, and prosecution of enablers. Estimated revenue: $30 billion annually.

### 7. Carbon Tax
$50/ton carbon tax with annual increases and a carbon dividend to households. Estimated revenue: $100 billion annually while accelerating the clean energy transition.

### 8. Estate Tax and Carried Interest Reform
Eliminate stepped-up basis, lower estate tax exemptions, close dynasty trust loopholes, and recharacterize carried interest as ordinary income. Combined revenue: $12 billion annually.

### 9. Cannabis Legalization and Taxation
Remove cannabis from Schedule I, create a federal regulatory framework under FDA/TTB, implement a rotating commercial license lottery to prevent monopolization, and impose federal excise taxes generating an estimated $20-30 billion annually at full implementation. Allocate 25% of cannabis tax revenue to communities harmed by the War on Drugs.

### 10. Employee-Friendly Company Tax Credits
Create a Good Employer certification with tax credits for companies maintaining 90%+ workforce retention (5% of payroll), providing 6%+ retirement contributions, and offering gold-level health coverage. A qualifying company with 500 employees and $50M payroll could earn $12.6 million in combined annual tax credits.

## Day One Executive Actions

- Direct IRS Commissioner to immediately prioritize audits of taxpayers with $1M+ income and $10M+ net worth, targeting an 8% audit rate for millionaires within 2 years
- Issue aggressive Treasury guidance implementing the Corporate Transparency Act to force disclosure of shell company owners
- Enhance FATCA enforcement and lower de facto reporting thresholds for foreign accounts
- Issue proposed regulations recharacterizing carried interest as ordinary income
- Direct FinCEN to accelerate beneficial ownership disclosure requirements
- Issue Treasury guidance permitting banks to serve licensed cannabis businesses
- Issue mass pardon for federal simple cannabis possession convictions

## The "Buy, Borrow, Die" Loophole

This is how billionaires legally pay zero taxes:

1. **BUY** appreciating assets (stocks, real estate). Appreciation is not taxed until sold. Billionaires never sell.
2. **BORROW** against assets at 1-3% interest. Loan proceeds are not taxable income. Use loans for living expenses.
3. **DIE** and pass assets to heirs with "stepped-up basis." All unrealized gains erased. Lifetime of gains completely untaxed.

Example: $1 billion invested in 1990, worth $100 billion in 2024. $99 billion in gains. Taxes paid: $0. This is legal. This is intentional. This ends now.

## By The Numbers

- **$650-700 billion:** Total new annual federal revenue from the full reform package
- **3.4%:** Average effective tax rate paid by the 25 richest Americans (2014-2018), versus 25%+ for working families
- **$600+ billion:** Annual tax gap -- taxes owed but not collected, primarily from the wealthy
- **$300 billion:** Annual revenue from the wealth tax alone (2% over $50M, 3% over $1B)
- **87,000:** IRS agent hirings cancelled by Project 2025
- **$0:** Federal income tax paid by Elon Musk in 2018 and Jeff Bezos in 2007 and 2011
- **0.1%:** Warren Buffett's true effective tax rate (ProPublica "Secret IRS Files")
- **50,000+:** New IRS personnel to be hired for high-wealth enforcement
- **$20-30 billion:** Annual cannabis tax revenue at full implementation

## Key Legislation Proposed

- **Billionaire Minimum Tax Act** -- 30-35% minimum tax on Total Economic Income for $100M+ net worth individuals
- **IRS Enforcement and Modernization Act** -- $80 billion over 10 years, 50,000+ new personnel, codified audit rate targets
- **Corporate Tax Fairness Act** -- Restore 28% rate, strengthen GILTI, increase stock buyback tax, close loopholes
- **Carried Interest Closure Act** -- Recharacterize carried interest as ordinary income with no transition period
- **Employee-Friendly Company Tax Incentive Act** -- Tax credits for companies maintaining stable employment, providing retirement plans, and offering comprehensive healthcare

## What This Revenue Can Fund

- Medicare for All (net new cost: $200-300B)
- Free Public Higher Education ($80B)
- National Social Housing Program ($70B)
- Universal Pre-K ($40B)
- Climate transition investments ($150B)
- Infrastructure modernization ($100B)
- Social Security expansion ($50-100B)
