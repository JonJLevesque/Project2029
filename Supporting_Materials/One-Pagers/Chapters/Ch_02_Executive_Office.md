# Chapter 2: Executive Office of the President -- One-Pager

## What the Executive Office of the President Does

The Executive Office of the President (EOP) comprises the institutional apparatus that supports presidential decision-making and coordinates executive branch operations. It includes the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), the National Security Council (NSC), the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). When functioning properly, the EOP provides expert analysis, facilitates interagency coordination, and ensures that presidential decisions are informed by professional expertise and constrained by law.

## What Project 2025 Did to the EOP

- **Weaponized OMB as "Air-Traffic Control":** Project 2025 directed OMB to serve as the instrument of presidential control over all agencies. Political appointees replaced career professionals in signing budget apportionments, enabling OMB to withhold congressionally appropriated funds from agencies resisting political directives (Project 2025, p. 45).
- **Called to "Bend or Break the Bureaucracy":** The blueprint's author, former OMB Director Russ Vought, explicitly stated the goal: "boldness to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will" (Project 2025, p. 44).
- **Politicized OIRA Regulatory Review:** OIRA was transformed from an evidence-based review body into a political enforcement arm, killing regulations that conflicted with conservative ideology regardless of statutory requirements or scientific evidence.
- **Purged NSC Career Expertise:** Project 2025 called for "staffing the vast majority of NSC directorates with aligned political appointees," excluding career Foreign Service Officers and intelligence analysts from national security decision-making.
- **Eliminated Transparency:** All mechanisms operated in secret to advance the President's agenda without public accountability or congressional oversight.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Restore OMB Independence and Integrity
Establish OMB Director as a 5-year Senate-confirmed term appointment removable only for cause. Require career civil service staffing in the Budget Review Division. Prohibit political considerations in budget formulation.

### 2. End Impoundment Abuse
Enforce automatic release of withheld funds if OMB does not receive congressional rescission approval within 45 days. Establish criminal penalties (5 years imprisonment) for unlawful withholding of appropriated funds.

### 3. Reform OIRA Regulatory Review
Prohibit OIRA from delaying regulations beyond statutory deadlines or killing regulations required by statute. Require cost-benefit analysis based on agency scientific findings. Impose a 90-day review deadline -- failure to act constitutes deemed approval.

### 4. Professionalize the National Security Council
Require minimum 50% career Foreign Service Officers, intelligence analysts, or military officers on NSC staff. Prohibit political loyalty tests for career NSC positions. Mandate that policy papers reflect dissenting agency views.

### 5. Restore Scientific Integrity
Require OSTP Director to hold a PhD in science or engineering with Senate confirmation. Select science advisory committee members through the National Academies, not political appointment. Establish criminal penalties for altering scientific findings for political purposes.

### 6. Establish Comprehensive Transparency
Publish all OIRA regulatory review communications within 30 days. Require quarterly congressional testimony from OMB Director, OIRA Administrator, and NSC Advisor. Mandate annual GAO audits of all EOP offices.

## Day One Executive Actions

- Restore OMB and OIRA independence and evidence-based analysis
- Rebuild National Security Council processes with career professional integration
- Restore scientific integrity policies across all EOP offices
- Implement transparency requirements including visitor logs and regulatory review disclosure
- Release all funds unlawfully withheld by OMB under Project 2025

## By The Numbers

- **$325 million annually:** Estimated cost of comprehensive EOP reform infrastructure
- **$20 billion annually:** Revenue from restored IRS tax enforcement, offsetting reform costs
- **50%:** Minimum career professional staffing requirement for NSC directorates
- **90 days:** Maximum OIRA regulatory review period before deemed approval
- **5 years imprisonment:** Criminal penalty for unlawful impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds

## Key Legislation Proposed

- **Executive Office Professional Standards and Accountability Act** -- Codifies merit-based staffing, professional qualifications, and transparency for all EOP offices with criminal penalties for violations
- **Office of Management and Budget Independence and Integrity Act** -- Restores OMB to objective budget analysis, prevents impoundment abuse, establishes OIRA regulatory review limits
- **National Security Council Professionalization and Oversight Act** -- Ensures career expertise in national security decisions, prevents intelligence politicization, establishes congressional oversight
- **Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policy Act** -- Restores scientific integrity, prohibits political interference in science, requires evidence-based policymaking
- **Executive Office Transparency and Accountability Act** -- Ensures public access, strengthens congressional oversight, protects whistleblowers with treble damages
