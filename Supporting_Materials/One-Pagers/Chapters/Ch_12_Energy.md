# Chapter 12: Department of Energy and Related Commissions -- One-Pager

## What the Department of Energy Does

The Department of Energy manages America's energy policy, nuclear weapons stewardship, and scientific research through 17 national laboratories. It oversees clean energy research and development, grid modernization, energy efficiency standards, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and coordinates with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on electricity markets and nuclear safety. The energy sector produces 73% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making DOE central to both climate action and economic competitiveness.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Department of Energy

- **Slashed Clean Energy R&D:** Cut clean energy research budgets by 70% -- solar research by 85%, wind by 80%, energy storage by 75%, and electric vehicle technology by 90% -- while increasing fossil fuel R&D spending and reviving failed "clean coal" programs.
- **Stalled Grid Modernization:** Blocked desperately needed transmission upgrades, leaving renewable energy projects stuck in years-long interconnection queues while aging 1960s-era infrastructure deteriorated. Renewable energy projects worth billions in investment were delayed.
- **Preserved Fossil Fuel Subsidies:** Maintained $20-50 billion in annual fossil fuel subsidies -- including intangible drilling costs deductions ($1.5B), percentage depletion allowance ($1B), domestic manufacturing deduction ($1B), and hidden subsidies from externalized health and environmental costs.
- **Weakened Efficiency Standards:** Rolled back appliance efficiency standards for light bulbs, dishwashers, furnaces, showerheads, and water heaters, costing consumers billions in higher energy bills while increasing emissions by millions of tons.
- **Captured FERC, Paralyzed NRC:** FERC failed to reform transmission planning, rubber-stamped gas pipelines, and allowed capacity markets to pay coal and gas plants to sit idle. NRC weakened aging reactor oversight, made no progress on nuclear waste disposal, and stifled advanced reactor licensing.
- **Redirected National Labs:** The 17 national laboratories -- DOE's crown jewels of scientific innovation -- were redirected from clean energy research to fossil fuel priorities, driving a brain drain of scientists and engineers.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Triple Clean Energy R&D Investment ($15 Billion Annually)
Restore and expand DOE research funding from $3 billion to $15 billion, refocusing national laboratories on batteries, solar, wind, geothermal, fusion, hydrogen, carbon removal, and grid technologies. Accelerate technology transfer from labs to private sector commercialization.

### 2. Deploy 500+ GW of Renewable Energy by 2030
Achieve 300 GW solar, 200 GW wind (including 30+ GW offshore), and 15 GW geothermal through extended tax credits, direct payment options, loan guarantees, streamlined permitting on federal lands, and agrivoltaics co-location with agriculture. Solar and wind are now the cheapest electricity sources in history.

### 3. Grid Modernization ($150 Billion Transmission Investment)
Build high-voltage transmission (including HVDC) connecting renewable-rich regions to demand centers, reform FERC cost allocation and interconnection queues, deploy smart grid technologies and distributed energy resources, and harden infrastructure against extreme weather and cyberattacks. Target: 200,000+ transmission jobs.

### 4. Eliminate Fossil Fuel Subsidies ($20+ Billion Annually)
Repeal intangible drilling costs deductions, percentage depletion allowances, and other fossil fuel tax preferences. Phase out over 3-5 years with worker and community transition assistance. No new coal leasing on federal lands. Oil and gas leasing at fair market value with methane prevention requirements.

### 5. Energy Storage Revolution (200+ GW by 2030)
Deploy massive battery storage from current 7 GW to 200+ GW through investment tax credits, utility procurement mandates, and R&D for long-duration technologies including flow batteries, compressed air, iron-air, and liquid metal systems. Solve the intermittency challenge and enable high renewable penetration.

### 6. Energy Justice for All Communities
Triple LIHEAP funding to $10 billion annually (from approximately $3 billion). Expand community solar to enable renters and low-income participation. Fund whole-home energy retrofits for low-income households. Establish prevailing wage requirements, registered apprenticeships, and local hire provisions for all federally supported clean energy projects.

### 7. Restore and Strengthen Efficiency Standards
Reinstate LED requirements, heat pump HVAC and water heater standards, and comprehensive appliance efficiency rules. Support zero-energy-ready building codes by 2030. Invest $20 billion in building energy efficiency retrofits prioritizing low-income households. Consumer savings: $500+ billion over 30 years while avoiding 1 billion tons of CO2.

### 8. Nuclear Safety and Innovation
Maintain safety-first NRC oversight of aging reactors with license extensions only if safety is demonstrated. Advance consent-based nuclear waste siting (no Yucca Mountain without Nevada consent). Invest $2 billion annually in advanced reactor R&D -- small modular, molten salt, and micro-reactors -- with a realistic commercial timeline of 2030s.

## Constitutional and Legal Basis

- **Commerce Clause** (Art. I, Section 8, cl. 3): Energy in interstate commerce subject to federal regulation
- **General Welfare Clause** (Art. I, Section 8, cl. 1): Energy security and environmental protection promote the general welfare
- **Department of Energy Organization Act** (42 USC Section 7101 et seq.): DOE mission of energy security, innovation, environmental quality
- **Federal Power Act** (16 USC Section 791a et seq.): FERC jurisdiction over interstate electricity transmission
- **Atomic Energy Act** (42 USC Section 2011 et seq.): NRC authority over nuclear materials and facilities
- **Energy Policy Act of 2005** and **Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007:** Efficiency standards, renewable incentives, smart grid

## The Bottom Line

Clean energy is cheaper, cleaner, healthier, more secure, and creates more jobs than fossil fuels. The energy transformation is underway globally. The question is whether America leads or follows. Project 2029 chooses leadership.
