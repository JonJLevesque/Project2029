# Chapter 7: Intelligence Community -- One-Pager

## What the Intelligence Community Does

The United States Intelligence Community (IC) comprises seventeen federal agencies and organizations responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence to protect national security. Led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), these agencies exist to provide objective, apolitical analysis to policymakers and to operate under constitutional and statutory frameworks designed to prevent abuse of their extraordinary powers. The IC's independence from political control is not a bureaucratic preference -- it is the foundational principle that makes intelligence useful. Analysis cooked to confirm political conclusions is not intelligence; it is propaganda.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Intelligence Community

- **Politicized the DNI:** Tulsi Gabbard, confirmed as DNI on February 12, 2025, had no intelligence background and a prior record of positions aligned with foreign adversary narratives. She moved immediately to purge career analysts, impose loyalty tests on incoming IC personnel, and hollow out the ODNI by more than 40%. Her appointment redefined the DNI's role from managing analytic independence to enforcing institutional loyalty to the executive.

- **Weaponized Security Clearances:** Revoked clearances of officials who reached conclusions politically inconvenient to the administration. The IC's most senior Russia analyst -- an officer with more than two decades of service -- was fired within months. Clearance revocation was used as a punitive tool against professional dissent, not as a legitimate security measure.

- **Cancelled Critical Intelligence Products:** Terminated the Global Trends report, a once-quadrennial strategic assessment published since 1997. Stripped climate change from the Annual Threat Assessment for the first time in over a decade. Cancelled intelligence products that contradicted administration narratives, degrading the nation's capacity to anticipate threats.

- **Fractured the Five Eyes Alliance:** Mishandled classified material and applied NOFORN designations to Ukraine war analysis, cutting off Five Eyes allied intelligence partners -- the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand -- from intelligence they had historically shared. Fractured the cornerstone of Western signals intelligence cooperation at a moment of acute geopolitical threat.

- **Gutted the CIA Workforce:** Initiated layoffs of approximately 1,200 CIA positions. Combined with ODNI reductions and purges across the 17-agency community, the IC lost institutional knowledge and operational capacity at the precise moment when Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea are most active and capable.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Restore DNI Independence
Establish a six-year fixed term for the DNI with one renewal. Require removal only for cause with 30-day congressional review. Prohibit political direction of intelligence assessments through statute. Protect dissenting analytic views with statutory safeguards.

### 2. Reinstate Purged Intelligence Professionals
Conduct a comprehensive review of all IC personnel separations and security clearance revocations since January 20, 2025. Offer reinstatement with back pay to all improperly dismissed professionals within 120 days. Prohibit loyalty tests -- including questions about January 6 and 2020 election results -- in IC hiring, assignment, and retention.

### 3. Rebuild the IC Inspector General and Whistleblower Protections
Reconstitute and fully fund the IC Inspector General. Restore the Whistleblowing and Source Protection Program at full staffing within 60 days. Codify multiple protected disclosure channels, anti-retaliation enforcement, legal fee indemnification, and a presumption of retaliation for adverse actions within 24 months of a protected disclosure.

### 4. Reform the FISA Court
Mandate amicus curiae for all Title I applications targeting U.S. persons and all Section 702 applications. Codify Woods Procedures with criminal penalties for knowing misrepresentation. Require warrants for backdoor searches of 702-collected data. Establish annual FISC transparency reporting and a 4-year Section 702 reauthorization cycle.

### 5. Restore Critical Intelligence Products
Reinstate the Global Trends strategic assessment program. Require comprehensive Annual Threat Assessments covering climate security, election interference, and the full spectrum of threats. Produce the suppressed 2025 Global Trends report and transmit it to Congress within 180 days.

### 6. Rebuild Five Eyes Relationships
Restore intelligence-sharing relationships with Five Eyes partners through binding classified information security commitments. Revoke the NOFORN directive on Russia-Ukraine intelligence. Enact the Allied Intelligence Partnership Protection Act with enhanced criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of partner intelligence.

### 7. Establish AI Governance and Counter Foreign Influence
Issue an Intelligence Community AI Governance Framework covering all seventeen IC components. Reconstitute the IC Election Security Initiative and brief officials in all 50 states. Establish the Foreign Malign Influence Center at the ODNI.
