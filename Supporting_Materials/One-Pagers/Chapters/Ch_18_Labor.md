# Chapter 18: Department of Labor -- One-Pager

## What the Department of Labor Does

The Department of Labor (DOL) is the federal government's primary institutional guardian of American workers. Established in 1913, it oversees more than 180 federal laws covering approximately 10 million employers and 125 million workers.

Its core divisions -- the Wage and Hour Division, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Employment and Training Administration, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Employee Benefits Security Administration -- form the legal architecture that separates a civilized labor market from exploitation. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), while an independent agency, operates in close coordination with DOL and its mandate is inseparable from the department's mission.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Department of Labor

- **Rolled Back Overtime Protections:** Endorsed reverting the overtime salary threshold from $58,656 to $35,568, stripping approximately 4.3 million salaried workers of overtime eligibility. Proposed allowing employers to average overtime across two- or four-week periods, eliminating overtime pay for workers with fluctuating schedules.
- **Gutted OSHA Enforcement:** Proposed exempting small businesses and first-time violators from OSHA fines, cut enforcement staff from 1,292 to 1,124, and reduced NIOSH from approximately 1,400 employees to fewer than 150 -- an 89 percent reduction in occupational safety research capacity.
- **Suppressed Union Organizing:** Directed the NLRB to narrow Section 7 concerted activity protections, reverse card check recognition, and enable captive audience meetings. The NLRB General Counsel was removed, and the Supreme Court's *Trump v. Wilcox* decision threatened the Board's independence.
- **Promoted Worker Misclassification:** Stopped enforcing the Biden-era independent contractor classification rule, allowing gig platforms to misclassify workers and deny them minimum wage, overtime, unemployment insurance, and the right to organize.
- **Privatized Apprenticeship Training:** Called for reviving Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs), which circumvent DOL's Registered Apprenticeship standards and eliminate union-negotiated quality requirements.
- **Collapsed Enforcement Capacity:** Federal wage and hour enforcement and OSHA combined collected only $130 million in penalties since January 2025 -- a 66 percent drop from prior years.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Raise the Federal Minimum Wage to $17 Per Hour
Enact the Minimum Wage Act of 2029 raising the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour in three annual steps ($13, $15, $17), indexed to CPI-W thereafter. Eliminate the federal tipped minimum wage entirely, ensuring all tipped workers receive the full minimum wage plus tips.

### 2. Restore and Codify Overtime Protections
Reinstate the $58,656 overtime salary threshold by executive order on Day One. Enact the Overtime Guarantee Act codifying the threshold with annual CPI indexing at the 55th percentile of full-time salaried worker wages, and permanently prohibiting multi-week overtime averaging schemes that allow employers to avoid paying time-and-a-half.

### 3. Pass the PRO Act
Pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act banning captive audience meetings, enabling card check recognition, establishing civil penalties of up to $50,000 per unfair labor practice, repealing right-to-work exemptions under Section 14(b), and creating personal liability for corporate officers who direct labor law violations. Expanded employee definitions will reduce supervisor and independent contractor misclassification that currently excludes millions from NLRA protections.

### 4. Fully Fund OSHA
Rebuild OSHA to achieve an inspector staffing ratio of one inspector per 2,500 workplaces by Year 4 (from the current one per 6,000). Reconstitute NIOSH from fewer than 150 employees to its full complement of 1,400 within two years. Finalize the heat standard within Year 1. Pursue criminal referrals for willful violations causing worker death. Eliminate the agricultural OSHA exemption.

### 5. Prosecute Wage Theft as a Federal Crime
Establish a DOL-DOJ Worker Protection Task Force with 50 dedicated prosecutors for criminal wage theft, labor trafficking, and child labor cases. Enact the Wage Theft Prevention and Accountability Act upgrading repeat willful wage theft to a federal felony punishable by up to five years imprisonment, with enhanced liquidated damages of three times wages owed. Target recovery of more than $1 billion annually in stolen wages by Year 4.

### 6. Protect Gig Workers from Misclassification
Reinstate and defend the Biden-era independent contractor rule on Day One. Pursue legislation codifying an ABC test in the FLSA, NLRA, and OSH Act, ensuring worker classification is determined by economic reality across all federal labor laws simultaneously. Workers misclassified as independent contractors lose minimum wage protections, overtime, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, the right to organize, and anti-discrimination protections.

### 7. Establish Federal Paid Family Leave
Pass the FAMILY Act creating a national paid family and medical leave insurance program providing 12 weeks of wage replacement at approximately 66 percent of wages, with universal coverage including part-time and self-employed workers. Funded through a joint employee-employer payroll contribution of approximately 0.2 percent each, administered by the Social Security Administration.

### 8. Rebuild the Registered Apprenticeship System
Permanently prohibit IRAPs by statute through the National Apprenticeship Act Modernization Act. Invest federal funds in expanding Registered Apprenticeship programs, targeting 800,000 active apprentices by Year 3 and 1 million by 2034, with 25 percent women and 40 percent workers of color representation in new programs. Provide federal apprentice wage subsidies for the first 12 months to encourage employer participation.

### 9. End Child Labor Exploitation
Enact the Child Labor Protection Enhancement Act increasing penalties to $100,000 per violation, upgrading willful violations causing serious injury to a federal felony, eliminating the agricultural child labor exemption, and establishing a dedicated Child Labor Enforcement Unit with 50 investigators within the Wage and Hour Division.
