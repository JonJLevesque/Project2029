## What the USDA Does

The United States Department of Agriculture governs the food system that sustains 330 million Americans and the agricultural economy that employs tens of millions more. Its mandate spans food safety, nutrition assistance, conservation, rural development, trade, and research. USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which serves more than 42 million people monthly; the National School Lunch Program, which feeds approximately 30 million children each school day; the Farm Service Agency (FSA), which provides the financial safety net keeping family farms solvent; the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which pays farmers to steward their land; the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the largest publicly funded agricultural research system in the world; and the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which ensures the safety of the nation's meat, poultry, and egg supply.

## What Project 2025 Did to the USDA

- **Decimated the Workforce:** DOGE-directed mass terminations removed more than 20,000 USDA employees by mid-2025. ARS lost 1,523 scientists, including researchers with decades of irreplaceable expertise in ongoing long-term experiments. FSIS lost 555 experienced inspectors, with 63% from the front-line inspections group -- the people on whom meat, poultry, and egg safety depends. Rural Development and FSA offices were targeted for closure across the country, removing the only meaningful federal presence in many rural counties.

- **Largest SNAP Cut in American History:** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1, signed July 4, 2025) cut SNAP by $186 billion over ten years, stripping benefits from an estimated 22.3 million families. Work requirement age was raised from 55 to 65. Parents of children 14 and older now face work requirements, specifically targeting single-parent households. Veterans, homeless individuals, and former foster youth lost their exemptions. Federal administrative cost matching to states was cut from 50% to 25%.

- **Destroyed Climate-Smart Agriculture:** Cancelled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program covering 14,000 farmers, 135 partner organizations, and 3.2 million acres. Froze all Inflation Reduction Act USDA spending, including $8.45 billion in EQIP funding. Zeroed out Conservation Technical Assistance funding (from $776.5 million to zero in the FY2026 proposal). Halted CRP enrollment.

- **Undermined School Nutrition and Protected Monopolies:** Weakened school meal nutrition standards. Withdrew the Packers and Stockyards Act unfair practices rule and cancelled the enforcement partnership with state attorneys general. Four companies still control 85% of U.S. beef with no regulatory constraint on their market power.

- **Abandoned Rural America:** Targeted Rural Development and FSA offices for closure -- often the only federal presence in rural counties where farmers access loans, disaster assistance, and conservation contracts. Beginning farmers lost access to FSA loan officers and NRCS technical assistance. Emergency disaster response capacity was degraded at the moment it is most needed.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Restore and Permanently Protect SNAP
Repeal the SNAP provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Restore exemptions for veterans, homeless individuals, and foster youth. Restore 50% federal administrative cost matching. Permanently index benefits to the Thrifty Food Plan with automatic cost-of-living adjustments. Codify broad-based categorical eligibility. Target: reduce national food insecurity rate from 13.7% to below 8% by Year 4.

### 2. Rebuild the USDA Workforce
Offer reinstatement with back pay and full seniority to all DOGE-separated employees. Publish a five-year Workforce Recovery Plan within 60 days. Execute emergency FSIS inspector hiring to restore food safety capacity within 18 months. Reopen all closed FSA and Rural Development offices by Year 1. Protect ARS research facilities from executive closure through statute.

### 3. Relaunch Climate-Smart Agriculture
Reinstate the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program under CCC Charter Act authority (15 U.S.C. 713a). Establish $1 billion annually in permanent mandatory funding through the Climate-Smart Agriculture Investment Act. Raise the CRP acreage cap from 27 million to 35 million acres. Restore EQIP and Conservation Stewardship Program funding. Target: 25,000 farmers in climate-smart programs with verified emission reductions by Year 3.

### 4. Break Up Meatpacking Monopolies
Resume the Packers and Stockyards Act unfair practices rulemaking. Restore cooperative enforcement with state attorneys general. Direct AMS to publish a Meatpacking Market Concentration Report within 90 days. Target: reduce beef packing four-firm concentration from 85% to below 70% through antitrust enforcement and support for independent packing capacity.

### 5. Restore School Meal Nutrition Standards
Reissue 2022 school meal nutrition standards under 42 U.S.C. 1779 as interim final rules with immediate effect. Initiate notice-and-comment rulemaking for permanent, science-based standards by Year 1 end.

### 6. Invest in Rural America
Invest $10 billion over five years: $1 billion annually for rural broadband through ReConnect, $1.5 billion annually for rural water and wastewater infrastructure, $500 million annually for rural health facilities. Target 90% rural broadband coverage at 100/20 Mbps by Year 4. Reduce rural hospital closure rate to zero through the Rural Hospital Stabilization Grant Program.

### 7. Support Beginning Farmers and Food Systems Equity
Create a USDA Office of Food Systems Equity and an Office of Civil Rights Remediation ($25 million initial budget). Expand the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program to $75 million annually. Create a Farmland Access Program within FSA. Cap commodity payments at $125,000 per operation and redirect support from mega-farms to beginning, small, and mid-size producers.
