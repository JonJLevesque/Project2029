# Chapter 4: Department of Defense -- One-Pager

## What the Department of Defense Does

The Department of Defense is the largest employer in the world, with 2.1 million active duty and reserve service members and nearly 800,000 civilian employees. It exists to provide for the common defense under the civil-military compact at the heart of American democracy: professional military forces under firm civilian control, defending the Constitution rather than any individual leader. The DoD manages an approximately $850 billion annual budget, maintains alliances including NATO and Indo-Pacific partnerships, and is responsible for protecting the nation from external threats while upholding the constitutional order.

## What Project 2025 Did to the Department of Defense

- **Politicized Military Leadership:** Removed or forced retirement of generals and admirals who provided professional military advice contradicting political preferences. Promoted officers based on political reliability rather than military competence. Required public statements of political loyalty from Joint Chiefs.
- **Planned Domestic Military Deployment:** Drafted executive orders to invoke the Insurrection Act against protesters. Pre-positioned active duty military units near protest sites. Used military helicopters for crowd intimidation and pressured senior officers to participate in political photo ops.
- **Tolerated Extremism in the Ranks:** Eliminated DoD extremism screening programs (claiming they were "woke"), ended training on recognizing extremist recruitment, and disbanded diversity and inclusion offices despite 450+ service members and veterans being involved in the January 6 Capitol attack.
- **Gutted Military Justice Reforms:** Failed to address the sexual assault epidemic (an estimated 25,000+ assaults annually, with only 7% reported) and systemic racial disparities in UCMJ enforcement (Black service members 2.5x more likely to face court-martial).
- **Damaged Alliances:** Publicly threatened to leave NATO, refused to affirm Article 5 commitment, demanded "protection payments" from allies, and undermined Ukraine support -- emboldening adversaries and driving Indo-Pacific allies toward hedging with China.

## Top Reforms Proposed

### 1. Restore Civilian Control and Depoliticize Military
Day One Executive Order prohibits political loyalty tests for officers, restores professional military advice, and conducts a 90-day review of all general/flag officer removals during Project 2025 for potential restoration to duty.

### 2. Combat Extremism with Zero Tolerance
Reestablish DoD extremism screening programs. Implement mandatory extremism awareness training. Create specialized investigation units. Require FBI sharing of extremist watchlists with DoD. Discharge service members with verified extremist affiliations.

### 3. Reform Military Justice
Remove sexual assault prosecution from chain of command and assign to independent military prosecutors. Address racial disparities through blind charging reviews and diversity in the JAG corps. Strengthen due process and expand legal representation.

### 4. Restore Diversity and Inclusion
Rebuild diversity programs as military readiness imperatives. Restore outreach to minority communities for recruitment. Reinstate LGBTQ+ service member protections. Implement mentorship programs for underrepresented groups at all leadership levels.

### 5. Reform the Insurrection Act
Codify strict limitations on domestic military deployment: require actual rebellion (not protests), state request or inability, congressional notification within 24 hours, and automatic sunset after 14 days without congressional authorization.

### 6. Revitalize NATO and Indo-Pacific Alliances
Reaffirm Article 5 commitment on Day One. Restore full participation in alliance planning. Rebuild intelligence-sharing relationships. Strengthen AUKUS and Quad partnerships. Restore credible Taiwan deterrence.

### 7. Realign the $850 Billion Budget
Redirect spending from waste and cost overruns toward service member quality of life, readiness, climate adaptation, and emerging technologies. Reform acquisition to eliminate contractors charging $640 for toilet seats.

## Day One Executive Actions

- Issue Executive Order prohibiting political loyalty tests for military officers
- Affirm Posse Comitatus Act compliance and end all plans for domestic military deployment against civilians
- Reaffirm NATO Article 5 commitment and restore alliance engagement

## By The Numbers

- **450+ service members/veterans:** Involved in the January 6 Capitol attack, per Pentagon reports
- **25,000+ sexual assaults annually:** Estimated by anonymous DoD surveys, with only 7% reported
- **2.5x more likely:** Rate at which Black service members face court-martial compared to white counterparts
- **75% of goal:** Army recruitment achievement, with all services missing targets
- **35% to 65%:** Drop in officer confidence in senior leadership under politicization
- **$850 billion:** Annual DoD budget requiring realignment toward readiness and service member needs

## Key Legislation Proposed

- **Insurrection Act Reform Act** -- Codifies strict limitations on domestic military deployment with congressional notification, sunset provisions, and judicial review
- **Military Justice Improvement Act** -- Removes sexual assault prosecution from chain of command and assigns to independent prosecutors
- **Military Extremism Prevention Act** -- Mandates extremism screening, training, and zero-tolerance enforcement with Inspector General oversight
