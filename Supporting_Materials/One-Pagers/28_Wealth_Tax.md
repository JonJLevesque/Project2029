# ONE-PAGER #28: WEALTH TAX
## Addressing Extreme Inequality Through Annual Wealth Taxation

**[See Chapter 22 for Complete Details]**

---

## THE PROBLEM

**Wealth inequality in America has reached levels not seen since the Gilded Age.**

### The Shocking Numbers:

| Group | Share of U.S. Wealth |
|-------|---------------------|
| Top 1% | **32%** ($44 trillion) |
| Top 10% | **67%** |
| Bottom 50% | **2.5%** |

### The Billionaire Explosion

| Year | Number of U.S. Billionaires | Combined Wealth |
|------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| 1990 | 66 | $125 billion |
| 2000 | 298 | $1 trillion |
| 2010 | 403 | $1.3 trillion |
| 2020 | 614 | $3.2 trillion |
| 2024 | **735** | **$5.5 trillion** |

**One family (Waltons) has more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans combined.**

### Why Wealth Taxes Matter

**Income taxes don't work for the ultra-wealthy because:**

1. **They don't earn "income"**—they accumulate assets
2. **"Buy, Borrow, Die"** lets them avoid taxes entirely
3. **Capital gains** are taxed at lower rates (if at all)
4. **Dynasty wealth** compounds forever

**The Effective Tax Rate Problem:**

| Group | Effective Tax Rate |
|-------|-------------------|
| Top 400 families | **8.2%** |
| Average taxpayer | **25%+** |
| Warren Buffett | **0.1%** |

**The wealthy pay LOWER rates than working families.**

## THE SOLUTION: ANNUAL WEALTH TAX

### The Proposal

**Progressive Annual Tax on Net Worth:**

| Net Worth | Annual Tax Rate |
|-----------|----------------|
| Under $50 million | 0% |
| $50 million - $1 billion | **2%** |
| Over $1 billion | **3%** |

### How It Works

**Net Worth =** Total assets - Total liabilities

**Assets Include:**
- Stocks, bonds, mutual funds
- Real estate (excluding primary residence up to $2M)
- Private business interests
- Art, collectibles, yachts, aircraft
- Retirement accounts (exempted)
- Life insurance cash value

**Example: Billionaire with $10 Billion Net Worth**

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Net worth | $10 billion |
| First $50 million | $0 (exempt) |
| $50M to $1B (2%) | $19 million |
| Above $1B (3%) | $270 million |
| **Total Wealth Tax** | **$289 million** |

**After-tax return:** If assets grow 7%, they still gain $421 million after tax. Wealth still grows—just more slowly.

## BY THE NUMBERS

### Revenue Potential

**Annual Revenue:** $250-300 billion

| Bracket | Taxpayers | Revenue |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| $50M - $1B | ~90,000 households | $150B |
| Over $1B | ~735 households | $150B |
| **Total** | ~90,735 | **$300B** |

### What $300 Billion Annually Can Fund:

| Investment | Annual Cost |
|------------|-------------|
| Free public college | $80 billion |
| Universal pre-K | $60 billion |
| Housing First | $20 billion |
| Child care subsidy | $40 billion |
| Clean energy transition | $50 billion |
| **Total** | $250 billion |

**One tax on 90,000 households funds transformative investments for 330 million Americans.**

## THE INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE

### Countries with Wealth Taxes:

| Country | Rate | Threshold |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Switzerland | 0.3-1% | ~$100K |
| Norway | 1% | ~$170K |
| Spain | 0.2-3.75% | ~$700K |
| Colombia | 0.5-1.5% | ~$1M |
| Argentina | 0.5-1.75% | ~$200K |

**Switzerland has had a wealth tax for over 100 years.** It has not collapsed. It remains one of the world's most competitive economies with high quality of life.

### The "But France Repealed It" Argument

France's wealth tax failed because:
- It exempted business assets (easy avoidance)
- It was poorly designed
- It didn't have exit taxes

**The lesson: Design it well.** Include all assets, add exit taxes, enforce compliance.

## LEGAL BASIS

### Constitutional Authority

**The debate: Is a wealth tax a "direct tax" requiring apportionment?**

**Arguments FOR Constitutionality:**

1. **Apportionment is unworkable** for wealth-based taxes—SCOTUS has recognized practical exceptions
2. **16th Amendment** authorizes taxation "from whatever source derived"
3. **Estate taxes** are constitutional—and they're taxes on accumulated wealth
4. **Original meaning:** Founders didn't contemplate modern asset wealth; "direct taxes" meant head taxes and land taxes
5. **Precedent:** Federal property taxes on carriages upheld without apportionment (*Hylton v. United States*, 1796)

**Key Legal Scholarship:**
- Ackerman & Alstott, *The Stakeholder Society*
- Tribe & Dorf on constitutional interpretation
- Multiple law review articles supporting constitutionality

**Backup Plan: Constitutional Amendment**

If courts strike down the wealth tax:

> **Proposed 28th Amendment:**
> "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on wealth, from whatever source held, without apportionment among the several States."

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Preventing Avoidance:**

| Tactic | Counter-Measure |
|--------|----------------|
| Move assets offshore | Worldwide taxation + FATCA enforcement |
| Hide assets in trusts | Trust look-through rules |
| Undervalue assets | Third-party appraisal requirements, IRS audit |
| Renounce citizenship | **40% exit tax on unrealized gains** |
| Convert to exempt assets | Narrow exemptions |

## Q&A

**Q: Is a wealth tax constitutional?**

A: Strong legal arguments support constitutionality. The 16th Amendment, estate tax precedent, and practical interpretation of "direct taxes" all support it. If courts disagree, we pursue a constitutional amendment—just as we did for the income tax in 1913.

**Q: Won't wealthy people just leave?**

A: The plan includes a **40% exit tax** on unrealized gains. You can leave, but you'll pay on your way out. Plus, most wealthy people stay even in countries with wealth taxes—Switzerland, Norway, and Spain all retain their wealthy residents.

**Q: Can you really value all these assets?**

A: Yes. We already value assets for estate taxes, divorce proceedings, and financial statements. Publicly traded securities are easy. Private businesses can use formulaic valuation or third-party appraisals. Art and collectibles already get appraised for insurance and estate purposes.

**Q: Won't this hurt the economy?**

A: No. Wealth concentration actually HURTS the economy by reducing aggregate demand. Redistributing from those who hoard to those who spend stimulates growth. Every dollar taxed from a billionaire and spent on public goods circulates more productively.

**Q: What about liquidity? Can billionaires actually pay?**

A: Absolutely. If they can borrow billions against their assets to buy more assets (or rockets), they can borrow to pay taxes. Plus: 5-year installment options available for illiquid assets.

**Q: This is class warfare!**

A: Class warfare has been waged by the wealthy for 40 years—and they've been winning. Top tax rates cut from 70% to 37%. Wealth concentrated dramatically. Unions crushed. This is self-defense, not attack. Asking billionaires to contribute 2-3% annually isn't warfare—it's basic fairness.

## TALKING POINTS

**"The wealthy already pay the most taxes!"**
> They pay more in absolute dollars because they have the most money. But their *rate*—the percentage they pay—is often lower than working families. Warren Buffett pays a lower rate than his secretary. That's not fair.

**"They'll just move to Monaco."**
> Exit tax. Plus, most don't move. Switzerland has had a wealth tax for over a century. Norway has one. The wealthy stay because they like living in stable democracies with good infrastructure, not because of tax rates.

**"This punishes success!"**
> No one becomes a billionaire alone. They use public infrastructure, educated workers, legal systems, and research funded by taxpayers. The wealth tax asks them to pay back into the system that made their success possible.

**"A wealth tax will destroy investment!"**
> The wealthy don't invest because of tax rates—they invest because they want returns. A 2-3% annual tax doesn't eliminate the incentive to grow wealth. It just modestly slows the compounding of extreme inequality.

**"What's next, coming for everyone's homes?"**
> The threshold is $50 million. 99.9% of Americans are completely unaffected. This is about extreme concentrated wealth, not middle-class savings.

## THE DIFFERENCE FROM BILLIONAIRE MINIMUM TAX

| Feature | Billionaire Minimum Tax | Wealth Tax |
|---------|------------------------|------------|
| What's taxed | Economic income (including gains) | Total net worth |
| Rate | 30-35% of income | 2-3% of wealth |
| Frequency | Annual (on gains) | Annual (on total) |
| Threshold | $100 million net worth | $50 million net worth |
| Revenue | $25-40B annually | $250-300B annually |

**Both can work together.** The billionaire minimum tax ensures wealthy pay something on their gains. The wealth tax slowly addresses accumulated concentration.

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**A 2-3% annual wealth tax on fortunes over $50 million would raise $250-300 billion annually—enough to fund free public college, universal childcare, and affordable housing while barely affecting the ultra-wealthy's ability to accumulate even more.**

**The choice is simple: Do we want a democracy, or an oligarchy? Wealth taxes are how we preserve government of, by, and for the people—not just the billionaires.**

**Tax the rich. Fund the future.**
