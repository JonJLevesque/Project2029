# REFORM #5: RESTORE THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE
## Balanced News Requirement. End Propaganda Masquerading as News.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**The Fairness Doctrine was eliminated in 1987. Democracy has suffered ever since.**

**What happened after 1987:**
- Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, MSNBC: partisan propaganda 24/7
- No requirement for balance or opposing viewpoints
- "News" became entertainment and rage-bait
- Americans live in separate information bubbles
- Shared reality destroyed

**Current state of "news":**
- Fox News viewers believe different facts than MSNBC viewers
- No accountability for spreading lies
- Social media algorithms amplify extremism
- Foreign adversaries exploit divisions
- Democracy requires informed citizens—we have misinformed tribes

**By the numbers:**
- Americans who trust media: 32% (down from 70%+ in 1970s)
- Average cable news viewer: watches ONLY their partisan channel
- Factual errors on cable news: rampant, rarely corrected
- Time spent on balanced coverage: near zero
- Foreign disinformation spreading on social media: millions of pieces

**The result:**
- Political polarization at all-time high
- Families divided over misinformation
- Violence against perceived enemies
- Democratic discourse impossible (no shared facts)

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Digital Era Fairness and Accountability Act

**Part I: Restore Fairness Doctrine for Broadcast (Immediate)**

**FCC shall require all broadcast licensees (TV and radio):**

1. **Balanced Coverage Requirement:**
   - Controversial public issues must present opposing viewpoints
   - Equal time for major political perspectives
   - Cannot present only one side of disputed issue

2. **Labeling Requirement:**
   - "Opinion" must be clearly labeled (not presented as news)
   - "News" must be fact-based, balanced, sourced
   - Disclaimers required for speculation

3. **Correction Requirement:**
   - Factual errors corrected with equal prominence
   - Corrections within 24 hours
   - Fines for repeated violations

4. **Enforcement:**
   - FCC can fine violators ($100k per violation)
   - Can revoke broadcast licenses for egregious violations
   - Public can file complaints

**Constitutional Basis:**
- Broadcasters use PUBLIC airwaves (government-granted licenses)
- Not a violation of free speech—it's a condition of using public resource
- *Red Lion Broadcasting v. FCC* (1969): Fairness Doctrine is constitutional

**Part II: Extend to Cable News (New)**

**Cable news networks must:**

1. **Accurate Labeling:**
   - If you call yourself "news," you must provide NEWS (fact-based, balanced)
   - Opinion shows clearly labeled as opinion (not news)
   - Networks primarily opinion-based must rebrand ("Fox Opinion Network," not "Fox News")

2. **Fact-Check Requirement:**
   - Networks must fact-check hosts' claims in real-time
   - Corrections prominently displayed
   - Repeated falsehoods = show suspended

3. **Balanced Programming:**
   - Networks must provide minimum 30% balanced coverage daily
   - Cannot be all left or all right propaganda
   - Opposing viewpoints must be presented fairly (not straw-manned)

4. **Enforcement:**
   - FCC/FTC joint oversight
   - Fines for violations ($500k per violation)
   - Can force rebranding (Fox News → Fox Opinion if egregious)

**Constitutional Basis:**
- Commercial speech (advertising) is regulated—"news" can be too
- Not censorship—just accuracy in labeling
- Consumer protection (people think they're getting news)

**Part III: Social Media Platform Accountability (New)**

**Major platforms (100M+ users) must:**

1. **Algorithm Transparency:**
   - Disclose how algorithms prioritize content
   - Allow users to opt out of engagement-based algorithms
   - Chronological feed must be option

2. **Amplification Balance:**
   - Political content amplification must be balanced
   - Cannot algorithmically favor one party/viewpoint
   - Trending topics vetted for accuracy

3. **Disinformation Response:**
   - Remove/label verified disinformation within 24 hours
   - Bot networks identified and removed
   - Foreign influence operations disclosed

4. **Enforcement:**
   - FCC/FTC joint oversight
   - Fines up to 1% of global revenue per violation
   - Can mandate algorithm changes

**Constitutional Basis:**
- Platforms are publishers when they curate/amplify content
- Can be regulated like other media
- Not government censorship—platforms already moderate

**Part IV: Public Broadcasting Expansion**

**NPR, PBS, Public Broadcasting Grants:**
- Quadruple funding: $2 billion → $8 billion/year
- Mandate balanced coverage (center-left and center-right perspectives)
- Expand reach to compete with cable news
- Free, high-quality, fact-based news for all Americans

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Isn't this censorship and a First Amendment violation?"**
→ NO. Fairness Doctrine is a CONDITION of using public airwaves (broadcast licenses). Cable/social media regulation is consumer protection (accurate labeling) and publisher accountability (they curate content). First Amendment protects speech—not lies marketed as news.

**"Who decides what's 'fair' or 'balanced'?"**
→ FCC with public input and judicial review (like all regulations). "Fair" means presenting multiple major perspectives on controversial issues. "Balanced" doesn't mean 50/50 on settled science—it means representing legitimate viewpoints proportionally. Courts review for viewpoint discrimination.

**"Won't conservatives say this targets Fox News?"**
→ It targets ALL propaganda, left and right. If MSNBC violates balance requirements, they get fined too. The goal is NEWS, not propaganda in either direction. If Fox provides actual news, no problem. If they're 95% opinion, rebrand as "Fox Opinion."

**"How is this different from government-controlled media?"**
→ Government-controlled media tells outlets WHAT to say. Fairness Doctrine tells them HOW to present (balanced, fact-based, labeled). Huge difference. Outlets choose content, but must be honest about what it is (news vs. opinion) and present multiple sides.

**"What about editorial discretion?"**
→ Preserved. Outlets choose which issues to cover. They just can't present ONLY one side of controversial issues. Opinion shows are fine—just label them as opinion. News divisions must be news. Editorial freedom remains, propaganda is just held accountable.
