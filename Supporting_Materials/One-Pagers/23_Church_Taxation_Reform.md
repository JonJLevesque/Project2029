# REFORM #23: CHURCH TAXATION & 501(c)(3) RESTRUCTURING
## Tax Exemption for Genuine Charity Only. Churches Operating as Businesses Pay Taxes Like Businesses.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**The current tax-exempt system allows churches and religious organizations to accumulate vast wealth, operate as for-profit businesses, engage in political activity, and provide minimal charitable services—all while paying ZERO taxes.**

### Mega-Churches: Entertainment Businesses Disguised as Religion

**Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church (Houston):**
- **Revenue:** $90+ million/year
- **Pastor's net worth:** $50-100 million
- **Facility:** $105M arena renovation (tax-exempt)
- **Business model:** Book sales, conferences, merchandise
- **Charitable aid:** <10% of revenue
- **Taxes paid:** $0
- **Property tax avoided:** $1-2 million/year

**Kenneth Copeland Ministries:**
- **Revenue:** $300+ million/year
- **Pastor's assets:** $750 million net worth, multiple private jets ($20M+ Gulfstream V)
- **Message:** "Give money to get rich" (prosperity gospel)
- **Victims:** Low-income followers fund pastor's luxury
- **Taxes paid:** $0

**Creflo Dollar:**
- **Asked followers to donate for:** $65 million Gulfstream G650 jet
- **Solicitation:** 200,000 people × $300 each
- **Result:** Tax-exempt donations fund private aircraft

### Massive Wealth Hoarding: $100 Billion and Zero Charity

**Mormon Church (LDS):**
- **Total assets:** $100-150 BILLION
- **Annual tithing:** $7 billion
- **Stock portfolio:** $40+ billion (Ensign Peak Advisors)
- **Charitable spending:** $40 million/year (0.6% of tithing)
- **2019 whistleblower:** Revealed church accumulated $100B while spending <1% on charity
- **Taxes paid:** $0
- **Tax avoided:** Billions annually

**This is a hedge fund with religious branding.**

### Political Activity: Systematic Violations, Zero Enforcement

**Law:** 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) PROHIBITS tax-exempt organizations from political campaign activity.

**Reality:** Systematically violated, never enforced.

**Examples:**
- **Hundreds of evangelical pastors:** Endorsed Trump from pulpits (illegal)
- **"Pulpit Freedom Sunday":** Annual event where churches DELIBERATELY violate law
- **Catholic bishops:** Denied communion to pro-choice politicians (Biden, Pelosi)
- **Voter guides:** Distributed materials favoring specific candidates
- **IRS enforcement:** Trump's 2017 executive order directed IRS NOT to enforce
- **Prosecutions:** ZERO

**Result:** Churches operate as partisan political organizations, pay no taxes.

### Real Estate Empires: Billions in Property, Zero Property Tax

**Trinity Church Wall Street (NYC):**
- **Property:** $6 BILLION in Manhattan real estate
- **Revenue:** Tens of millions from commercial rents
- **Property tax avoided:** $50-100 million/year

**Scientology:**
- **Clearwater, FL:** Owns 60+ downtown properties (all tax-exempt)
- **Business model:** Real estate acquisition and appreciation
- **Property tax avoided:** Millions annually

**Catholic Church (US):**
- **Largest private landowner in America**
- **Property tax exemption:** $10-20 billion/year nationwide

### The IRS "Church Audit" Shield: Why Abuse Goes Unpunished

**26 U.S.C. § 7611 gives churches special protection:**
- IRS must have "reasonable belief" of violations BEFORE auditing (no other nonprofits protected this way)
- Regional IRS commissioner must personally approve
- Church gets advance notice, can challenge in court
- Limited audit scope even when approved

**Result:**
- **Churches nationwide:** ~350,000
- **Church audits per year (2010-2020):** <10
- **Audit rate:** 0.003%
- **Other 501(c)(3) audit rate:** 0.5-1% (300x higher)

**Churches can accumulate wealth, violate political laws, operate businesses, enrich pastors—with near-ZERO risk of IRS scrutiny.**

### The Scale of Abuse

**Federal income tax lost:** $20-70 billion/year
**Property tax lost (state/local):** $10-20 billion/year
**TOTAL TAX AVOIDANCE:** $30-90 billion/year

**What this could fund instead:**
- $20B = 400,000 teachers at $50k/year
- $20B = Healthcare for 4 million uninsured
- $20B = Free community college for 2 million students
- $20B = Housing vouchers for 500,000 families

**Instead: Tax-exempt donations fund private jets, mansions, real estate empires, political campaigns.**

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Tax-Exempt Status Requires 67% Charitable Distribution

**Core Reform:** Tax exemption under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) requires organizations distribute **at least 67% of GROSS REVENUE** (not profit—REVENUE) to direct charitable activities.

**If you don't give away 67%, you're not a charity—you're a business. Businesses pay taxes.**

### What Counts as "Charitable" (The 67%)

**COUNTS toward 67%:**
- Direct assistance to needy (food, housing, healthcare)
- Educational programs OPEN TO PUBLIC (not just members)
- Community services (addiction recovery, job training, childcare)
- Disaster relief, humanitarian aid
- Medical care, public health services
- Scientific research for public benefit
- Environmental conservation
- Programs benefiting disadvantaged populations

**DOES NOT COUNT toward 67%:**
- Salaries and benefits (clergy, staff)
- Building maintenance, utilities, rent
- Administrative overhead
- **Religious worship activities** (services, ceremonies, rituals)
- **Member-only programs** (serving congregation, not community)
- Capital campaigns, property acquisition
- Investment management fees
- **Lobbying and political activities**
- Marketing, fundraising costs
- **Proselytizing/missionary work** (conversion-focused, not material aid)

### How It Works: Real Examples

**Lakewood Church (Joel Osteen):**
- **Revenue:** $90 million
- **Salaries/admin:** $25 million
- **Building/utilities:** $15 million
- **Worship services:** $20 million
- **Member programs:** $10 million
- **ACTUAL charitable aid:** $10 million
- **Charitable distribution:** 11% → **LOSES tax exemption**
- **New tax liability:** $90M × 21% = **$18.9 million/year**

**Community Food Bank:**
- **Revenue:** $5 million
- **Admin:** $800,000
- **Food distribution:** $3.5 million
- **Job training:** $600,000
- **Charitable distribution:** 82% → **KEEPS tax exemption**

**Mormon Church:**
- **Revenue:** $7 billion (tithing)
- **Charitable spending:** $40 million (0.6%)
- **Result:** **LOSES tax exemption**
- **New tax liability:** $7B × 21% = **$1.47 billion/year**
- **Message:** Either give away 67% ($4.7B/year in actual charity) OR pay taxes like the hedge fund you are**

### Churches Must Choose

**Option 1: Be a REAL Charity**
- Distribute 67%+ of revenue to genuine charitable activities
- Serve the PUBLIC and DISADVANTAGED, not just your members
- Maintain tax exemption
- Continue paying no taxes

**Option 2: Admit You're a Business**
- Don't meet 67% threshold
- Lose tax exemption
- Pay corporate income tax (21% federal rate)
- Pay state/local property taxes
- Still operate freely—just pay taxes like everyone else

**There is NO Option 3** where you accumulate wealth, enrich pastors, operate as a business, serve only members, AND pay no taxes. That's over.

### Elimination of Church Audit Special Protection

**Repeal 26 U.S.C. § 7611** (special church audit restrictions)

**New reality:**
- Churches audited under SAME procedures as all other nonprofits
- No "reasonable belief" requirement before audit
- No special approval needed
- No advance notice
- IRS can investigate like any other organization

**Audit rates:**
- Organizations >$50M revenue: 100% audit rate
- Organizations $10-50M: 25% audit rate
- Organizations $1-10M: 10% audit rate
- Organizations <$1M: 2% audit rate

**Result: Systematic enforcement. Abuse detected. Violators lose exemption.**

### Enforcement Mechanism

**Year 1: Rulemaking**
- Treasury issues proposed regulations
- Public comment period
- Final regulations published
- All 501(c)(3)s notified: 67% distribution required starting Year 2

**Year 2: Transition**
- Organizations file under new rules
- Educational outreach
- Warnings issued for non-compliance
- No immediate enforcement (compliance assistance period)

**Year 3+: Full Enforcement**
- Organizations failing 67% threshold → lose exemption immediately
- Taxed as C-corporations at 21% federal rate
- Property tax exemption also revoked (state/local coordination)
- Can no longer receive tax-deductible donations
- Appeals available but burden on organization to prove compliance

**Fraud/Misrepresentation:**
- Criminal tax evasion charges (26 U.S.C. § 7201)
- Civil penalties up to 75% of underpayment
- Organizational leadership personal liability
- Permanent bar from tax-exempt status

## 💰 REVENUE & IMPACT

### New Federal Revenue

**Conservative estimate:** $30-50 billion/year
**Realistic estimate:** $40-70 billion/year
**Optimistic estimate:** $70-100 billion/year

**Organizations losing exemption:**
- Mega-churches accumulating wealth: 40% fail → $59B taxable
- Religious organizations hoarding assets: 35% fail → $51B taxable
- Hospital systems with low charity care: 25% fail → $300B taxable
- Elite universities with massive endowments: 15% fail → $99B taxable

**Tax at 21% corporate rate (effective ~14% after deductions):** $30-71 billion federal revenue

**Additional state/local property tax:** $40-60 billion/year

### Who Loses Exemption, Who Keeps It

**LOSE exemption (don't meet 67%):**
- Lakewood Church (Joel Osteen): 11% charitable → **pays taxes**
- Mormon Church: 0.6% charitable → **pays taxes**
- Kenneth Copeland Ministries: <5% charitable → **pays taxes**
- Trinity Church Wall Street: Asset accumulation → **pays taxes**
- Mega-churches primarily serving members: **pay taxes**
- Prosperity gospel operations: **pay taxes**
- Real estate empires: **pay taxes**

**KEEP exemption (meet 67%):**
- Community food banks: 80%+ charitable → **tax-exempt**
- Homeless shelters: 85%+ charitable → **tax-exempt**
- Addiction recovery programs: 75%+ charitable → **tax-exempt**
- Community health clinics: 70%+ charitable → **tax-exempt**
- Small churches genuinely serving communities: **tax-exempt**
- Religious hospitals providing substantial charity care: **tax-exempt**

**Result: Tax exemption reserved for organizations ACTUALLY serving communities, not accumulating wealth.**

## 🎯 HOW YOU CAN HELP

### Individual Actions
1. **Demand church taxation** - contact representatives
2. **Ask your church:** "What percentage of revenue goes to charitable aid?" (Most won't know because they don't track it)
3. **Support real charities** - food banks, shelters, community services (they'll keep exemption)
4. **Vote** for candidates supporting tax fairness
5. **Share this information** - most don't know scale of abuse

### Organizational Actions
1. **Endorse 67% distribution requirement**
2. **Calculate your distribution** - prove you meet threshold
3. **Transparency pledge** - disclose finances publicly (even though churches aren't required to)
4. **Model genuine charity** - actually serve your community
5. **Coalition building** - real charities support this (they already meet 67%)

### Political Actions
1. **Primary challenge** members protecting church tax abuse
2. **Town halls:** Ask about mega-church wealth accumulation
3. **Support tax fairness candidates**
4. **State/local:** Model laws for property tax (67% threshold)

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"This violates Free Exercise of Religion!"**
→ No. *Employment Division v. Smith* (1990): Neutral tax laws don't violate Free Exercise even if they burden religious practice. Churches remain FREE to practice religion—they just pay taxes if they don't meet charitable threshold. No constitutional RIGHT to tax exemption exists.

**"Churches will close and communities will lose services!"**
→ Churches providing REAL community services (food banks, shelters, health clinics) will EASILY meet 67% and keep exemption. Churches primarily serving their own members and accumulating wealth will pay taxes—as they should. If your "service" is so minimal you can't meet 67%, you're a private club, not a charity.

**"What about small churches that can't afford this?"**
→ Small churches (<$1M revenue) face only 2% audit rates. Genuine community churches will meet 67%. Small churches accumulating wealth rather than serving should pay taxes. Size doesn't matter—charitable purpose matters.

**"67% is too high! Why not 50%?"**
→ 67% ensures organizations are PRIMARILY charitable. At 50%, you could spend more on overhead/salaries than charity and claim exemption. Threshold must be high enough that "tax-exempt" actually means "substantially dedicated to public benefit." Private foundations already distribute 5% of assets annually—our 67% of revenue is MORE generous.

**"This will reduce charitable giving!"**
→ No evidence supports this. Donors can still deduct contributions even if receiving organization pays corporate tax. Organizations genuinely serving communities will meet threshold. Those that don't weren't providing sufficient charitable value to justify tax subsidy.

**"What about worship services? Aren't those charitable?"**
→ Worship services serve MEMBERS, not the general public or disadvantaged populations. They're religious practice, which is protected—but not automatically "charitable" for tax purposes. If your only activity is worship services for members, you're a private religious club. Nothing wrong with that, but private clubs pay taxes.

**"Mormon Church gives $40 million to charity!"**
→ $40 million out of $7 billion revenue = 0.6%. They're hoarding $100+ billion. Either distribute $4.7B/year (67% of $7B) in REAL charity OR pay $1.47B/year in taxes like the hedge fund you are. Those are the options.

**"Joel Osteen inspires millions!"**
→ Great—he can keep doing that. But if Lakewood Church only distributes 11% to actual charity, it's an entertainment business, not a charity. Entertainment businesses pay taxes. Osteen can still preach, sell books, fill arenas—just pay corporate income tax and property tax like other businesses.

## 🔥 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Tax exemption is a PRIVILEGE for organizations serving the PUBLIC GOOD, not a RIGHT for accumulating private wealth.**

**The current system allows:**
- Mega-churches to operate as entertainment businesses (pay $0 taxes)
- Pastors to buy private jets with tax-exempt donations
- Religious organizations to hoard $100+ BILLION while giving <1% to charity
- Churches to violate political activity laws with zero enforcement
- Real estate empires to pay zero property taxes while cities go broke

**This is SYSTEMIC ABUSE enabled by special legal protection.**

**The 67% solution is simple:**
- Give away 67%+ of revenue to genuine charitable activities → Tax-exempt (keep exemption)
- Don't meet 67% → You're a business, pay taxes like a business (lose exemption)

**Churches remain FREE to practice religion either way. They just can't avoid taxes while operating as for-profit businesses.**

**Mega-churches have a choice:**
1. **Become real charities** (distribute 67%+ to serve communities) → tax-exempt
2. **Admit they're businesses** (accumulate wealth, enrich pastors) → pay taxes

**There is no Option 3** where you get tax exemption while hoarding wealth. That loophole closes.

**This reform:**
- Generates $30-90 billion/year for teachers, healthcare, housing, education
- Ensures tax exemption reserved for REAL charities
- Ends systemic abuse by mega-churches and religious organizations
- Applies EQUALLY to all organizations (secular and religious)
- Churches genuinely serving communities KEEP exemption

**Tax fairness. Genuine charity. Democratic integrity.** 🇺🇸
