# ONE-PAGER #25: SOCIAL HOUSING FOR AMERICA
## The Vienna/Singapore Model for Affordable Housing

**[See Chapter 15 for Complete Details]**

---

## THE PROBLEM

**Housing in America is a crisis.**

**The Numbers:**
- **650,000** Americans homeless on any given night
- **50%** of renters pay more than 30% of income on housing
- **7 million** unit shortage of affordable housing
- **30%+** rent increases since 2019
- **$400,000+** median home price (unattainable for most)

**Why It's Getting Worse:**

**Wall Street Bought Your Neighborhood:**
- Institutional investors own 30%+ of rentals in some markets
- Blackstone, Invitation Homes buy up homes, raise rents 10-20%
- Housing treated as investment vehicle, not human need

**Speculation Over Shelter:**
- Investors buy, flip, profit—without adding supply
- Airbnb removes 1 million+ units from rental market
- Prices driven by speculation, not fundamentals

**Public Housing Abandoned:**
- Capital fund cut 50%+
- Buildings deteriorating
- Wait lists: 2-10 years
- Only 1 in 4 eligible families receives assistance

**Result:** Working families one crisis away from the street.

## THE SOLUTION: SOCIAL HOUSING

### What Is Social Housing?

**Social housing** is publicly-owned or nonprofit housing available to all income levels—not just the poor. It's a **public good**, like libraries or parks.

### The International Evidence

**Vienna, Austria:**
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Social housing share | 60% of residents |
| Average rent | 20-25% of income |
| Quality | Indistinguishable from market |
| Mixed-income | All income levels together |
| Homelessness | Near-zero |
| Political support | Universal (everyone uses it) |

**How Vienna Does It:**
- City owns the land (eliminates land cost)
- Mixed-income: Middle class AND low-income together
- Beautiful design (no stigma)
- 100-year buildings (quality investment)
- Result: Stable housing costs for 100 years

**Singapore:**
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Public housing share | 80% of population |
| Quality | High-rise, modern, well-maintained |
| Homeownership | 90%+ (99-year leases) |
| Integration | Mandated ethnic mixing |

## THE AMERICAN MODEL

### National Social Housing Program

**Investment:** $50 billion annually (mandatory spending)

**Production Targets:**
| Year | Units Produced | Cumulative |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Year 1 | 100,000 | 100,000 |
| Year 5 | 200,000/year | 850,000 |
| Year 10 | — | 1.5 million |
| Year 20 | — | 3 million |

**Target: 30% of housing stock as social housing by 2050**

### Mixed-Income Design (Critical!)

| Income Level | Share | Rent |
|--------------|-------|------|
| Very Low (<30% AMI) | 30% | 30% of income |
| Low (30-50% AMI) | 30% | 30% of income |
| Moderate (50-80% AMI) | 20% | 30% of income |
| Middle (80-120% AMI) | 20% | Below market (75%) |

**Why Mixed-Income:**
- **No stigma:** Not "the projects"—quality housing for everyone
- **Cross-subsidy:** Higher rents help fund lower rents
- **Social integration:** Diverse communities
- **Political durability:** Middle class has stake
- **Quality:** Competition with market

### Key Features

**Location:** Near jobs, transit, services (not concentrated poverty)

**Quality:** Beautiful design, durable construction, community spaces

**Governance:** Regional housing authorities (bypass NIMBY localities)

**Resident power:** Tenant councils with board representation

## COMPLEMENTARY REFORMS

### Community Land Trusts ($10B Fund)
- Nonprofit owns land permanently
- Homeowners buy/rent buildings
- Affordability locked in forever
- Community governance

### Anti-NIMBY Zoning Preemption
- As-of-right multifamily near transit
- Federal override of exclusionary zoning
- ADU legalization everywhere
- End parking minimums near transit

### Fair Housing Restoration
- Reinstate AFFH rule
- Source-of-income protection (federal)
- Algorithm auditing for lending
- Triple HUD fair housing enforcement

## BY THE NUMBERS

**Investment:** $50B annually social housing + $10B Housing First + $10B CLT

**Total Annual Cost:** ~$74 billion

**Funding Sources:** Wealth tax ($300B), carbon tax ($100B), corporate tax reform ($150B)—housing easily covered

**Return on Investment:**
- 5 jobs per housing unit built
- Reduced emergency spending ($5-10B)
- Economic output from housing stability
- Health improvements

---

## LEGAL BASIS

**Federal Authority:**
- **Commerce Clause:** Housing markets are interstate commerce
- **Spending Clause:** Federal grants to housing authorities
- **Fair Housing Act:** Affirmatively further fair housing
- **Housing Act of 1937:** Public housing authority

**Preemption Authority:**
- **Supremacy Clause:** Federal law preempts local exclusionary zoning
- ***Texas Dept. of Housing v. Inclusive Communities* (2015):** Disparate impact valid under FHA
- ***Gonzales v. Raich* (2005):** Broad Commerce Clause authority

**Day 1 Executive Actions:**
1. Reinstate AFFH rule (HUD regulatory authority)
2. Housing First directive for homeless grants
3. Fair housing enforcement priority
4. Environmental review streamlining

## Q&A

**Q: Isn't public housing always terrible?**

A: American public housing was deliberately underfunded and segregated. Vienna's social housing is beautiful—architects compete to design it. Quality depends on investment and integration. We're proposing the Vienna model, not repeating past mistakes.

**Q: Can the government really build housing?**

A: The government built millions of homes during and after WWII. The GI Bill, public housing, Fannie Mae—government created middle-class homeownership. We did it before; we can do it again.

**Q: Won't this kill the private market?**

A: Vienna has both social AND market housing. Social housing provides stability and competition. Private developers can still build—they just can't exploit monopoly power. Markets work better with public alternatives.

**Q: Why should middle-class people get social housing?**

A: Because universal programs have political durability. Social Security and Medicare are untouchable because everyone uses them. Housing for all income levels builds coalition and eliminates stigma.

**Q: $50 billion a year is a lot!**

A: We spend $200+ billion annually on tax breaks for homeowners (mortgage interest deduction, capital gains exclusion). We subsidize the wealthy. This rebalances toward everyone.

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Housing is a human right, not a commodity for Wall Street speculation.

With $50 billion annually, we can build 1 million units in 10 years and transform American housing.**

**We choose homes over hedge funds.**
