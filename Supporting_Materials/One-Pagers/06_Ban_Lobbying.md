# REFORM #6: BAN/LIMIT LOBBYING
## End the Revolving Door. Politicians Serve the People, Not Special Interests.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**Lobbying has corrupted American democracy:**
- $3.7 BILLION spent on federal lobbying annually
- 12,000+ registered lobbyists in DC (23 for every member of Congress)
- 50%+ of former members of Congress become lobbyists
- Industries write their own regulations through captured officials
- Public interest crushed by corporate money and access

**The Revolving Door:**
1. Politician serves in Congress/Administration
2. Makes policies favorable to industry
3. Leaves office
4. Industry hires them as lobbyist for $500k-$2M/year
5. Former official lobbies former colleagues
6. Cycle repeats (institutionalized corruption)

**Real examples:**
- Tom Daschle (former Senate Majority Leader): $2M+/year lobbying
- Billy Tauzin (former House Energy Chair): $11.6M over 5 years lobbying for Big Pharma
- Eric Cantor (former House Majority Leader): Became Wall Street lobbyist immediately
- 80+ former members of Congress currently lobbying

**The result:**
- Laws written by industries they're supposed to regulate
- Public interest ignored in favor of corporate profit
- Corruption so normalized it's barely called corruption
- Democracy for sale to highest bidder

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Lobbying Prohibition and Transparency Act

**Part I: Ban the Revolving Door (Permanent)**

**Members of Congress:**
- **LIFETIME BAN** on becoming registered lobbyist after leaving office
- Cannot lobby former colleagues, staff, or executive branch
- Cannot be "shadow lobbyist" (unregistered but doing same work)
- Violators: 10 years prison + $1 million fine

**Cabinet Secretaries & Senior Officials:**
- **10-YEAR BAN** on lobbying after leaving office
- Applies to all Senate-confirmed positions
- Includes "shadow lobbying" and consulting for lobbying firms
- Violators: 5 years prison + $500k fine

**Congressional Staff:**
- **5-YEAR BAN** on lobbying former boss or committee
- Applies to all senior staff (chiefs of staff, legislative directors, committee staff)
- Cannot join lobbying firms even in "non-lobbying" roles (no loopholes)
- Violators: 2 years prison + $100k fine

**Why These Lengths?**
- Lifetime ban for Congress: They make the laws—should never profit from that access
- 10 years for Cabinet: By then, relationships and insider knowledge stale
- 5 years for staff: Balances fairness with preventing exploitation
- All dramatically longer than current weak 1-2 year "cooling off" periods

**Part II: Restrict Corporate Lobbying**

**Registration Requirements (Expanded):**
- ALL contacts with officials must be registered (not just "substantial" time)
- Includes "shadow lobbying" - if it looks like lobbying, it IS lobbying
- No $3,000 threshold—ALL lobbying disclosed
- Quarterly reports with details of contacts, topics, amounts paid

**Spending Limits:**
- Corporations can spend maximum $100,000/year on lobbying (down from unlimited)
- Trade associations limited to $500,000/year
- No circumventing through multiple entities
- Violators: lose lobbying privileges for 5 years + fines

**Gift Ban (Total):**
- ZERO gifts from lobbyists to officials (no exceptions)
- No meals, no travel, no campaign contributions bundled by lobbyists
- No hiring officials' family members
- Violators: 2 years prison + termination

**Foreign Agent Registration (Strengthened):**
- Foreign governments/companies CANNOT hire former US officials (ever)
- Must disclose all foreign funding sources (no shell companies)
- Violators: 5 years prison + deportation if not citizen

**Part III: Empower Public Interest**

**Public Lobbying Fund:**
- $100 million/year to fund public interest advocates
- Match corporate lobbying with environmental, consumer, labor voices
- Grants to nonprofits for lobbying in public interest
- Level the playing field (corporations vs. people)

**Congressional Access Equity:**
- Public interest groups get equal meeting time with members
- "Office hours" for constituents (vs. lobbyists only)
- Public comment periods before votes
- End "pay to play" culture

## 💰 COST & FUNDING

**Enforcement Cost:** $100 million annually
- 100 DOJ attorneys dedicated to lobbying violations
- FBI investigative unit
- Database maintenance
- International cooperation (foreign lobbying)

**Public Lobbying Fund:** $100 million annually
- Grants to public interest groups
- Levels playing field vs. corporate lobbying

**Lost Economic Activity:** Lobbyists lose jobs (feature, not bug)
- 12,000 lobbyists → maybe 2,000 (83% reduction)
- Law firms lose lobbying revenue (good—corrupt income)
- DC economy adjusts (was built on corruption anyway)

**Total Cost:** $200 million/year

**Revenue Source:**
- Fines on violators (estimated $50M/year)
- Remaining $150M from general appropriation
- Tiny fraction of federal budget
- Return: priceless (democracy restored)

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Don't people have a right to petition government?"**
→ YES—citizens do. But the First Amendment doesn't guarantee a right to be PAID to petition, or to exploit former government positions for private profit. We're banning the revolving door corruption, not citizen advocacy.

**"Won't this hurt former officials' ability to earn a living?"**
→ They can work in THOUSANDS of other careers. They just can't sell their access and insider knowledge to special interests. Congressional salary is $174k—they're not struggling. If money is why you enter public service, you're there for wrong reasons.

**"Lobbying provides expertise to lawmakers!"**
→ Lawmakers have staff, think tanks, universities, constituent input, and GAO for expertise. What lobbyists provide is MONEY and ACCESS. That's not expertise—that's corruption. Public interest groups in Public Lobbying Fund can provide actual expertise.

**"Is lifetime ban too harsh?"**
→ No. Members of Congress MAKE THE LAWS. Profiting from that power by lobbying is legalized bribery. If you want to be a lobbyist, don't run for Congress. If you run for Congress, accept that public service means serving the PUBLIC, not cashing in afterward.

**"Won't this limit free speech?"**
→ No. Former officials can speak, write, teach, consult on policy. They just can't LOBBY—contacting officials on behalf of clients for money. That's not speech, it's selling influence. Huge difference.

## 🔥 THE BOTTOM LINE

**The revolving door is legalized corruption.**

Politicians make laws favoring industries, then those industries hire them for millions. **That's a bribe with a time delay.**

**Lifetime ban for Congress = simple:**
- If you serve in Congress, you can NEVER lobby
- You knew the rule when you ran
- Thousands of other careers available
- Public service is service, not a stepping stone to wealth

**10-year ban for Cabinet, 5-year for staff = reasonable:**
- Long enough that relationships stale
- Short enough that career not destroyed
- Still dramatic improvement over current 1-2 years

**Plus corporate lobbying restrictions = game over for swamp:**
- Spending limits
- Total gift ban
- Full transparency
- Public interest funded equally

**"Drain the swamp" stops being a slogan and becomes reality.** 🇺🇸
