# REFORM #19: CIVIC EDUCATION OVERHAUL
## Media Literacy, Critical Thinking, Democratic Values. Prepare Citizens.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**Civic education has collapsed—democracy suffers:**

**Current state:**
- Only 9 states require one year of US government/civics
- 31 states don't require civics for high school graduation
- Average student: 30 minutes/week on civics (vs. 5 hours on math)
- Media literacy: virtually nonexistent (0% of students get comprehensive training)
- Critical thinking: not systematically taught
- Democratic values: assumed, not taught

**By the numbers:**
- Only 23% of 8th graders proficient in civics (NAEP)
- 40% of Americans can't name three branches of government
- 60% can't pass US citizenship test (immigrants study for)
- 70% of teens can't distinguish news from sponsored content
- Disinformation thrives because citizens can't evaluate sources

**The result:**
- Citizens don't understand how government works
- Can't distinguish fact from fiction
- Fall for propaganda and disinformation
- Don't participate effectively in democracy
- Democracy weakens with each generation

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Isn't this the parents' job?"**
→ Parents AND schools. Democracy requires informed citizens—that's a PUBLIC interest, not just private. We teach math, science, reading in schools because society needs educated people. Democracy needs civically educated people even more. Plus, not all parents have knowledge/time to teach civics comprehensively.

**"Will this indoctrinate kids?"**
→ OPPOSITE. Critical thinking and media literacy PREVENT indoctrination. Teaching ABOUT democracy isn't indoctrination—it's education. We teach how government works, not which party to support. Media literacy helps kids resist propaganda from ALL sides. This is education, not indoctrination.

**"Can't kids learn this on their own?"**
→ NO. Disinformation is too sophisticated. Social media algorithms are too manipulative. Critical thinking must be TAUGHT systematically—it doesn't develop naturally. We don't expect kids to learn calculus on their own—why expect them to learn media literacy without teaching?

**"Is this a federal overreach into education?"**
→ Federal FUNDING with state implementation (not mandate). States can refuse funds if they want (but why would they?). Federal government has always supported education—this is investment, not control. Plus, democracy is federal concern—need informed citizens for federal elections.

**"Can we afford $5 billion/year?"**
→ We spend $800+ billion/year on education—$5B is 0.6%. Less than one week in Afghanistan. If we can't afford to educate citizens for democracy, democracy will fail. This is insurance policy against authoritarianism. Worth every penny.
