# REFORM #11: ELECTION DAY FEDERAL HOLIDAY
## Make Voting Easy. No One Chooses Between Job and Democracy.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**Voting on a Tuesday while people work suppresses turnout:**

**Current reality:**
- Elections held on Tuesday (made sense in 1840s—farmers' market day)
- Most Americans work 9-5 jobs (can't easily vote)
- Long lines after work (3-4 hour waits in some areas)
- Hourly workers: lose pay if they leave to vote
- Parents: juggling childcare and voting
- Result: millions don't vote because they can't

**By the numbers:**
- 35% of non-voters say "too busy" or "work schedule" is reason
- Hourly workers: 20% less likely to vote than salaried
- Parents with young children: vote at lower rates
- Long lines (2+ hours): concentrated in poor/minority areas
- Early voting: not available everywhere, still requires time off

**International comparison:**
- Most democracies vote on weekends or make Election Day a holiday
- Australia: Saturday voting, 90%+ turnout
- France, Germany: Sunday voting, 70-80% turnout
- US: Tuesday, 60% turnout (40% in midterms)

**The result:**
- Working-class Americans vote at lower rates
- Democracy less representative
- "Too busy to vote" shouldn't be a thing

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Election Day National Holiday Act

**Make Election Day a Federal Holiday:**

**Core Provision:**
- First Tuesday in November (presidential and midterm years) = **FEDERAL HOLIDAY**
- All federal employees get day off (paid)
- Federal government encourages businesses to give employees day off

**Worker Protections:**

1. **Mandatory Time Off to Vote:**
   - **All employers** (not just federal) must give employees time to vote
   - Minimum 3 hours off (more if needed for long lines)
   - **Cannot require use of vacation/sick time**
   - **Must be PAID time** (no lost wages)

2. **Penalties for Violations:**
   - $10,000 fine per employee denied time to vote
   - DOL enforcement
   - Private right of action (employees can sue)

3. **Shift Worker Protections:**
   - Essential workers who can't leave jobs (nurses, police, etc.): employers must allow voting before/after shift
   - Early voting and mail-in voting ensures everyone can vote
   - No one should have to choose between job and voting

**Enhanced Voting Access:**

**Beyond the Holiday:**
- **Early Voting: 15 days before Election Day** (all states)
- **Mail-in voting: no-excuse absentee** (all states)
- **Polling hours: 6am-10pm minimum** (accommodate all schedules)
- **Polling locations: schools, community centers** (close to where people live)

**Civic Celebration:**
- Encourage "Democracy Day" celebrations
- Schools closed → can be polling locations
- Community events celebrating democracy
- Make voting a positive social experience

**Business Incentives:**
- Tax credit for businesses that give employees full day off
- Public recognition for "Democracy Champions" (businesses that make voting easy)
- "I Voted" campaigns (employers encourage voting)

## 💰 COST & FUNDING

**Federal Holiday Cost:** $0 to federal government
- Federal employees already get paid (just not working that day)
- No new spending

**Lost Productivity (Private Sector):** $20 billion
- One day of reduced economic activity
- Partially offset by consumer spending (people still shop, eat, etc.)
- Many businesses already close on holidays

**Early Voting Expansion:** $2 billion (one-time)
- Additional polling locations
- Extended hours for 15 days
- Staff costs
- Federal grants to states

**Annual Operating Costs:** $500 million
- Extended voting hours (staff)
- Additional polling locations
- Security and administration

**Tax Credits for Businesses:** $1 billion/year
- Incentivize giving workers day off
- Revenue loss to federal government

**Total Annual Cost:** $1.5 billion/year + $20B lost productivity

**Revenue Source:** General appropriation

**Return on Investment:**
- Voter turnout increase: 5-10% (10-20 million more voters)
- Democracy strengthened: priceless
- Civic engagement: increased
- One day of reduced productivity = worth it for democracy

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Won't this hurt the economy?"**
→ One day. We have 11 federal holidays already—one more won't hurt. Plus, democracy IS the economy—better government = better economic policy. Countries with high voter turnout (and weekend/holiday voting) have strong economies. It's worth one day to strengthen democracy.

**"Can't people just vote early or by mail?"**
→ Yes, and we should expand those too! But federal holiday PLUS early voting PLUS mail-in = maximum access. Not everyone can vote early (not available everywhere). Federal holiday ensures no one has to choose between job and voting. Redundancy is good—multiple ways to vote.

**"What about essential workers (nurses, police, etc.)?"**
→ Early voting (15 days) and mail-in voting ensure they can vote. Plus, employers must accommodate shifts. No one should have to choose between saving lives and voting—we give them options. Hospital staff can vote before/after shift or by mail.

**"Is this just a 'day off' for people who won't vote anyway?"**
→ Turnout data from countries with weekend/holiday voting shows 10-15% increases. Some will use it to relax, sure—but millions more will vote because they CAN. Even 5% turnout increase = 10 million more voters. Worth it.

**"Won't this favor Democrats?"**
→ **Democracy should be nonpartisan.** Higher turnout = more representative democracy. If one party benefits from making voting hard and the other from making it easy, that's a problem with the first party's platform, not with democracy. Every American should be able to vote easily.

- Economic impact analysis
- Implementation details

**Related Reforms:**
- #10: Automatic Voter Registration (registered + able to vote = full access)
- #4: Ban Gerrymandering (fair districts + high turnout = true representation)

- France: Sunday, 75% turnout
- Germany: Sunday, 76% turnout
- South Korea: Wednesday holiday, 77% turnout
- **US could achieve similar turnout with holiday + expanded access**

**Current US Voting Barriers:**
- Tuesday workday voting (vestige of 1840s)
- Limited early voting (some states)
- No-excuse mail-in not universal
- Long lines concentrated in working-class/minority areas
- Result: turnout suppressed by 10-20%

**Organizations Supporting Voting Access:**
- Why Tuesday? (election reform advocacy)
- League of Women Voters
- Brennan Center for Justice

## 🔥 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Voting on a Tuesday in 1840s made sense: farmers came to town on market day.**

**Voting on a Tuesday in 2025 makes zero sense: everyone's at work.**

**Solution: Make Election Day a holiday + expand early voting + mail-in voting.**

**Result:**
- No one chooses between job and democracy
- Workers get paid time off to vote
- Long lines reduced (voting spread throughout day + early voting)
- Turnout increases 10-15% (15-20 million more voters)
- Democracy becomes civic celebration, not obstacle course

**Other democracies figured this out decades ago.**

**Australia, France, Germany: weekend/holiday voting, 75-90% turnout.**

**US: Tuesday workday voting, 60% turnout (40% midterms).**

**We can do better.**

**Federal holiday + early voting + mail-in = everyone votes.** 🇺🇸
