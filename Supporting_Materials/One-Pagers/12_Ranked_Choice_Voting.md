# REFORM #12: RANKED-CHOICE VOTING NATIONWIDE
## Rank Your Choices. End the Two-Party Stranglehold.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**Current "plurality voting" system is broken:**

**How it works now:**
- Vote for ONE candidate
- Whoever gets most votes wins (even if <50%)
- Result: Two-party dominance, spoiler effect, strategic voting

**Problems:**

1. **Spoiler Effect:**
   - Third-party candidates "split the vote"
   - 2000: Nader takes votes from Gore → Bush wins Florida by 537 votes
   - 1992: Perot takes votes from Bush → Clinton wins with 43%
   - Voters punished for voting their true preference

2. **Two-Party Stranglehold:**
   - Third parties can't win (fear of spoiler effect)
   - Voters feel forced to pick "lesser of two evils"
   - No room for new parties or independent candidates
   - Political innovation stifled

3. **Negative Campaigning:**
   - Incentive to tear down opponents (not build yourself up)
   - "My opponent is terrible" instead of "here's my vision"
   - Politics becomes toxic

4. **Minority Rule:**
   - Winners with 35-40% of vote (60% voted against them)
   - Primaries: extremists win with 20-30% in crowded fields
   - Majority preferences ignored

5. **Strategic Voting:**
   - Vote for "electable" candidate, not favorite
   - "Don't waste your vote on third party"
   - True preferences hidden

**The result:**
- Two-party duopoly
- Polarization (no moderate alternatives)
- Voter dissatisfaction
- Democracy doesn't reflect actual preferences

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) Act

**How RCV Works:**

**Simple Concept: Rank candidates in order of preference**

1. **Vote:**
   - Rank candidates: 1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, etc.
   - Can rank as many or few as you want
   - Example: 1st: Independent, 2nd: Democrat, 3rd: Republican

2. **Count:**
   - Round 1: Count all 1st choice votes
   - If someone has majority (>50%): They win, done
   - If no majority: Eliminate candidate with fewest 1st choice votes
   - Redistribute eliminated candidate's votes to voters' 2nd choices
   - Repeat until someone has majority

**Example:**
```
10 voters:
- 4 voters: Democrat 1st, Independent 2nd
- 3 voters: Independent 1st, Democrat 2nd
- 3 voters: Republican 1st

Round 1: Democrat 4, Independent 3, Republican 3 (no majority)
Eliminate Republican (fewest votes)
Redistribute Republican voters' 2nd choices
(Assume Republican voters prefer Independent over Democrat)

Round 2: Democrat 4, Independent 6 (3 original + 3 from eliminated Republican)
Independent wins with 60% (majority)
```

**Result: Majority winner, no spoiler effect, true preferences count**

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

**Electoral Competition:**
- Viable third parties: 0-1 currently → 3-5 competitive
- Independent candidates: rare → common
- Political innovation: stifled → encouraged
- Two-party dominance: broken

**Campaign Dynamics:**
- Negative campaigning: reduced 40-50% (need 2nd choice votes from rivals' supporters)
- Positive campaigning: increases (build yourself up, don't tear down)
- Coalition building: incentivized (appeal to multiple groups)
- Toxic politics: decreases

**Representation:**
- Winners with majority support: 60% now → 100% (definition of RCV)
- Moderate candidates: more successful (appeal to broad coalition)
- Extremist primary winners: reduced (need >50% to win)
- Voter satisfaction: dramatically increases

**Voter Behavior:**
- Vote honestly for favorite: increases (no spoiler fear)
- Strategic voting: near elimination
- Voter turnout: increases 5-10% (more real choices)
- Third-party voting: 3% → 15-25% in first-choice votes

**Polarization:**
- Moderates viable: they can win by being everyone's 2nd choice
- Cross-party coalitions: incentivized
- Extremism: reduced (need broad appeal)
- Common ground: easier to find

## 🎯 HOW YOU CAN HELP

### Individual Actions
1. **Contact representatives** - demand RCV for federal elections
2. **Vote** for candidates supporting RCV
3. **Use RCV** if your locality has it (prove it works)
4. **Educate others** - most don't understand RCV yet
5. **Share this one-pager**

### Organizational Actions
1. **Endorse Ranked-Choice Voting Act**
2. **Support state/local RCV** (bottom-up momentum)
3. **Voter education** campaigns
4. **Coalition building** (cross-partisan support)
5. **Research and data** (show RCV works)

### Political Actions
1. **State ballot initiatives** (many states can implement RCV via referendum)
2. **Municipal RCV** (cities can adopt—then prove concept)
3. **Make it litmus test** - support RCV or lose vote
4. **Primary challenge** opponents
5. **Party platform inclusion** (DNC/RNC should endorse)

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Isn't this too complicated for voters?"**
→ NO. Voters in Alaska, Maine, NYC, Minneapolis, etc. use RCV successfully. It's simple: rank candidates in order of preference. That's it. More intuitive than strategic voting ("Who's electable? Who can win?"). Kids understand it immediately ("Favorite ice cream: 1. Chocolate, 2. Vanilla, 3. Strawberry").

**"Will this really break the two-party system?"**
→ YES. Look at Ireland (uses RCV): 8+ viable parties. Australia (RCV for 100+ years): multiple parties. Alaska (adopted RCV): Independent beat Republican in special election 2022. When voters can rank choices without fear, third parties become viable. Two-party duopoly relies on spoiler effect—RCV eliminates it.

**"Won't this help extreme candidates?"**
→ OPPOSITE. RCV helps MODERATES. Extremists might get 1st choice votes from base, but won't get 2nd choice votes from others. To win RCV, you need broad appeal (majority). Moderates who are "acceptable" to many groups (even if not 1st choice) do well. Primaries especially benefit—no more 25% extremist winners.

**"How long does it take to count?"**
→ Longer than plurality (maybe 1-2 days extra), but NOT weeks. Modern voting systems can handle instant runoffs quickly. Small delay is WORTH IT for democracy that reflects actual preferences. We already wait days for close elections—this is similar.

**"What if my 2nd choice helps beat my 1st choice?"**
→ That's not how RCV works. Your 2nd choice only counts if your 1st choice is ELIMINATED. If your favorite is still in the running, your vote stays with them. You never help your 2nd choice beat your 1st—only after your 1st loses.
