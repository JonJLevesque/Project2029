# REFORM #1: OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED
## End Corporate Money Dominance in Elections

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

**Citizens United v. FEC (2010)** = One of the most destructive Supreme Court decisions in American history.

**What it did:**
- Declared unlimited corporate political spending = "free speech"
- Allowed billionaires and corporations to buy elections
- Created super PACs (unlimited dark money)
- Made "one person, one vote" into "one dollar, one vote"

**The result:**
- **Oligarchy masquerading as democracy**
- Politicians beholden to donors, not voters
- Public faith in democracy destroyed
- Corruption legalized

**By the numbers:**
- $14+ billion spent on 2020 elections
- 0.01% of Americans provide 40%+ of campaign funds
- Super PACs outspend candidates in many races
- Foreign money laundered through shell companies

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Constitutional Amendment (30th Amendment Proposed)

**Text (Simplified):**
```
Section 1: Rights protected by Constitution are rights of NATURAL PERSONS only.
Corporations have NO constitutional rights.

Section 2: Federal, state, local governments SHALL regulate, limit, or prohibit
campaign contributions and expenditures.

Section 3: All contributions must be publicly disclosed.

Section 4: Congress and states have power to enforce by legislation.
```

**What this means:**
- Corporations aren't people → can be restricted from political spending
- Money isn't speech → can be limited to prevent corruption
- Government can set contribution limits
- Full transparency required

### Interim Reforms (While Amendment Pending)

**Year 1 Legislation:**

1. **DISCLOSE Act (Enhanced)**
   - All spending over $10,000 disclosed within 48 hours
   - No shell companies or dark money
   - Foreign money prohibition enforced
   - Criminal penalties for violations

2. **Stop Super PACs Act**
   - Restore coordination restrictions
   - Ban corporate/union super PAC contributions
   - Limit individual super PAC donations to $10,000/year

3. **Public Company Disclosure**
   - Shareholder approval required for political spending
   - Quarterly disclosure mandatory
   - Board accountability

4. **Federal Contractor Ban**
   - No political contributions from companies with federal contracts
   - Includes executives and lobbyists
   - Contract termination for violations

### Enforcement (Chapter 17: DOJ)

**Campaign Finance Enforcement Unit:**
- 50 attorneys dedicated to violations
- Criminal prosecution of knowing violations
- FBI coordination
- International cooperation (foreign money)

## 💬 TALKING POINTS

**"Don't corporations have free speech rights?"**
→ Corporations are legal fictions created by government. They have privileges, not rights. Free speech is for PEOPLE. Corporations can't vote, can't be jailed, can't die—they're not people.

**"Isn't money speech?"**
→ Money is a TOOL for speech, not speech itself. We regulate tools all the time without violating rights. You can't use a megaphone at 3am in a neighborhood. Money in politics is like that—reasonable limits to prevent harm.

**"Won't rich people still have advantages?"**
→ Yes, but we'll level the playing field. With public financing (Reform #9), small donors can compete. This doesn't make everything equal—it makes it fair.

**"Is the amendment realistic?"**
→ 19 states + 800+ municipalities have already called for it. Public support: 75%+ including majorities of Republicans. It's popular—just needs political will.

## 🔥 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Democracy dies when it's for sale.**

Citizens United turned our republic into an oligarchy where billionaires and corporations buy policy.

**The 30th Amendment restores the principle: One person, one vote.**

Not one dollar, one vote.

**This is the foundation of ALL other reforms.**

If corporations control elections, they control everything. **Fix this first.**
