# ONE-PAGER #26: HOUSING FIRST
## Ending Homelessness Through Permanent Housing

**[See Chapter 15 for Complete Details]**

---

## THE PROBLEM

**Homelessness in America is a national disgrace.**

### The Numbers:
- **650,000+** Americans homeless on any given night
- **127,000+** chronically homeless (homeless 1+ year with disability)
- **37,000+** homeless veterans
- **35,000+** unaccompanied homeless youth
- **171,500+** people in families with children

**And it's getting worse:**
- Homelessness increased **12%** in 2023 (largest single-year increase on record)
- Unsheltered homelessness up **23%**
- Family homelessness increased **16%**

### The Traditional Approach Has Failed

**"Treatment First" / "Housing Readiness" Model:**

1. Person becomes homeless
2. Must stay in emergency shelter (often unsafe, crowded)
3. Must achieve "housing readiness":
   - Complete substance abuse treatment
   - Maintain sobriety
   - Demonstrate "compliance"
   - Prove they "deserve" housing
4. Only then: Transitional housing
5. Only after that: Permanent housing (maybe)

**Results:**
- 40-50% success rate
- Average time homeless: 2+ years
- Many die on streets waiting to be "ready"
- Costs MORE than just providing housing

**The Fundamental Problem:** Treating housing as a reward rather than a right.

## THE SOLUTION: HOUSING FIRST

### What Is Housing First?

**Housing First** provides permanent housing **immediately**—no preconditions, no "readiness" requirements—then wraps services around the person.

### The Logic

You can't address mental health, addiction, or employment while living on the street. **Housing is the foundation for everything else.**

### How Housing First Works

| Step | Traditional Model | Housing First |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Emergency shelter | **Permanent housing immediately** |
| 2 | Treatment compliance | Voluntary services offered |
| 3 | Transitional housing | Case management support |
| 4 | Maybe permanent housing | Person stabilizes, recovers |

**Key Principles:**
- **No preconditions:** No sobriety, employment, or treatment requirements
- **Harm reduction:** Meet people where they are
- **Consumer choice:** Client-centered services
- **Community integration:** Scattered-site housing in regular neighborhoods
- **Recovery orientation:** Focus on strengths, not deficits

## THE EVIDENCE: IT WORKS

### Utah's Success

| Year | Chronic Homelessness | Result |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| 2005 | 1,932 people | Baseline |
| 2015 | 178 people | **91% reduction** |

**How:** Provided permanent supportive housing with wraparound services.

### Finland: National Success

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Only EU country reducing homelessness | Yes |
| Long-term homeless reduction | **35%** (2008-2019) |
| Rough sleepers | Near-zero |
| Approach | Housing First nationwide |

### Medicine Hat, Canada

**First city in North America to functionally end chronic homelessness** (2015)

### The Research

**Success Rate Comparison:**
| Model | Housing Retention |
|-------|------------------|
| Traditional "Treatment First" | 40-50% |
| Housing First | **80-90%** |

**Peer-Reviewed Evidence:**
- *At Home/Chez Soi* study (Canada, 2,000+ participants): 73% housing retention vs. 32% traditional
- *Pathways to Housing* (NYC): 88% housing retention over 5 years
- Meta-analyses confirm: Housing First outperforms traditional approaches

## THE AMERICAN HOUSING FIRST PLAN

### National Housing First Policy

**Investment:** $20 billion annually

**Production Targets:**
| Year | New PSH Units | Cumulative |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Year 1 | 20,000 | 20,000 |
| Year 2 | 25,000 | 45,000 |
| Year 3 | 25,000 | 70,000 |
| Year 4 | 25,000 | 95,000 |
| Year 5 | 25,000 | 120,000 |

**Target: Functional zero chronic homelessness within 5 years**

### Program Components

**1. Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH)**
- Affordable rental with on-site or linked services
- Case management, mental health, substance use treatment
- Employment assistance, life skills support
- For chronically homeless with disabilities

**2. Rapid Rehousing**
- Short-term rental assistance (3-24 months)
- Case management and housing navigation
- For families, individuals without chronic conditions
- Move people from shelter to housing quickly

**3. Prevention**
- Emergency rental assistance
- Eviction prevention legal services
- Utility assistance
- One-time crisis intervention

### Cost-Effectiveness

**Housing First actually SAVES money:**

| Cost Category | Annual Cost Without Housing | Annual Cost With Housing |
|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Emergency room visits | $18,000-30,000 | $3,000-5,000 |
| Hospital stays | $20,000-40,000 | $5,000-10,000 |
| Jail/prison | $25,000-50,000 | Minimal |
| Shelter | $15,000-20,000 | $0 |
| **Total** | **$78,000-140,000** | **$15,000-25,000** |

**Cost of PSH:** $15,000-25,000/year (including housing + services)

**Net Savings:** $50,000-115,000 per person per year

## LEGAL BASIS

**Federal Authority:**

**McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. § 11301 et seq.):**
- Established federal homeless assistance programs
- HUD authority to set program requirements
- Continuum of Care framework

**Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3601-3619):**

**Day 1 Executive Actions:**

1. **HUD Secretary Directive:** All Continuum of Care funds must prioritize Housing First
2. **VA Directive:** VASH vouchers must follow Housing First principles
3. **Interagency Council:** Establish Housing First as federal policy
4. **FEMA Coordination:** Disaster response must include Housing First

## Q&A

**Q: Don't people need to get sober first?**

A: No. Research consistently shows that housing stability IMPROVES recovery outcomes. You can't address addiction effectively while sleeping on the street. Housing First doesn't ignore substance use—it provides voluntary treatment alongside stable housing. Studies show equal or better substance use outcomes compared to "treatment first" models.

**Q: Won't this attract more homeless people?**

A: No. "Magnet" effects have not materialized in cities implementing Housing First. Most homeless people become homeless in their own communities due to local economic conditions. Effective programs reduce homelessness, not increase it.

**Q: What about people who don't want housing?**

A: Very few people truly prefer homelessness. Most who decline services have had negative experiences with shelters or don't trust the system. Patient outreach and client-centered approaches work. Housing First respects autonomy while persistently offering options.

**Q: Isn't this rewarding bad behavior?**

A: Housing isn't a reward—it's a basic human need. Requiring suffering as a prerequisite for assistance is cruel and counterproductive. The goal is ending homelessness, not punishing people for being poor.

**Q: We can't afford this.**

A: We're already paying MORE through emergency rooms, jails, and shelters. Housing First is cheaper than the status quo. The question isn't whether we can afford Housing First—it's whether we can afford NOT to implement it.

## TALKING POINTS

**"These people just don't want to work."**
> Most homeless people ARE working or seeking work. Homelessness is primarily a housing affordability crisis, not a character flaw. Many homeless people have jobs but can't afford rent.

**"We've tried everything—nothing works."**
> We've tried shelter-based, treatment-first approaches. They don't work. Housing First has an 80-90% success rate. We haven't tried Housing First at scale. When we do, it works.

**"Housing won't solve addiction/mental illness."**
> You're right—but you can't address those issues effectively without stable housing. Housing First doesn't ignore treatment; it provides housing as the foundation for recovery.

**"Not in my neighborhood!"**
> Permanent supportive housing is often indistinguishable from other apartments. Studies show PSH does NOT increase crime or reduce property values. Integration is better than concentration.

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Homelessness is solvable. Housing First has an 80-90% success rate—nearly double traditional approaches. It's more humane AND more cost-effective. With $20 billion annually, we can functionally end chronic homelessness in America within 5 years.**

**The choice is clear: We can keep paying more for failure, or we can invest in what works.**

**Housing First. Because housing is a human right.**
