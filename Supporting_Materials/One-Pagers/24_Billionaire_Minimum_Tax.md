# ONE-PAGER #24: BILLIONAIRE MINIMUM TAX
## Making Billionaires Pay Their Fair Share

**[See Chapter 22 for Complete Details]**

---

## THE PROBLEM

**Billionaires pay lower tax rates than nurses, teachers, and firefighters.**

### The Shocking Truth (ProPublica "Secret IRS Files"):

| Billionaire | Effective Tax Rate |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Warren Buffett | 0.1% |
| Jeff Bezos | 0.98% |
| Michael Bloomberg | 1.3% |
| Elon Musk | 3.27% |
| **Average American** | **25%+** |

**How is this possible?**

The wealthy use a simple strategy called **"Buy, Borrow, Die"**:

1. **BUY:** Acquire stocks, real estate, businesses
   - Appreciation is not taxed until sold
   - Billionaires never sell—they hold forever

2. **BORROW:** Take loans against assets
   - Loan proceeds are NOT taxable income
   - Interest rates for billionaires: 1-3%
   - Live lavishly without ever "realizing" income

3. **DIE:** Pass assets to heirs with "stepped-up basis"
   - All lifetime appreciation ERASED
   - Heirs inherit at current value
   - Entire fortune passes without income tax

**Example:** $1 billion invested in 1990 grows to $100 billion by 2024. Taxes paid on $99 billion gain: **$0**.

## THE SOLUTION: 30-35% BILLIONAIRE MINIMUM TAX

### Policy Design

**Rate:** 30-35% minimum tax on "Total Economic Income"

**Total Economic Income =**
- Adjusted Gross Income (traditional)
- PLUS: Unrealized gains on publicly traded assets
- PLUS: Imputed return (5%) on illiquid assets (business, real estate, art)
- MINUS: Realized losses (with carryback)

**Who Pays:** Taxpayers with **$100 million or more** in total assets

### How It Works

| Asset Type | Treatment |
|------------|-----------|
| Stocks, bonds | Mark-to-market annually |
| Private businesses | 5% imputed return OR defer with interest |
| Real estate | 5% imputed return OR defer with interest |
| Art, collectibles | 5% imputed return |
| Retirement accounts | Exempt until distribution |

### Liquidity Protections
- 10-year installment payment option
- Loss carryback (5 years) if values decline
- Treasury hardship exception (unlikely for billionaires)

## BY THE NUMBERS

**Revenue:** $250-400 billion over 10 years ($25-40 billion annually)

**Who's Affected:**
- ~700 billionaires in the United States
- ~10,000-20,000 taxpayers with $100M+ net worth
- They hold $5+ trillion in wealth
- Current effective rate: 3-8%
- New effective rate: 25-35%

**Example: Billionaire with $50 Billion**
- Stock portfolio: $40B (10% appreciation = $4B unrealized gain)
- Private business: $8B (5% imputed = $400M)
- Real estate: $2B (5% imputed = $100M)
- **Total Economic Income: $4.5 billion**
- **Minimum Tax (30%): $1.35 billion**
- Current system: **$0**

## LEGAL BASIS

**Constitutional Authority:**

**16th Amendment (1913):**
> "Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived..."

**Key Points:**
- "Whatever source derived" gives Congress broad power
- Congress already taxes unrealized gains in multiple contexts
- *Moore v. United States* (2024): Court did NOT rule unrealized gains can't be income

**Existing Mark-to-Market Precedents:**
- IRC § 475: Securities dealers
- IRC § 1256: Regulated futures
- PFIC rules: Passive foreign investment companies
- Original Issue Discount: Interest taxed before received

**Day 1 Executive Actions:**
1. IRS Commissioner directive: High-wealth audit priority
2. Treasury beneficial ownership guidance
3. Announce audit rate targets: 15% for $10M+ income

## Q&A

**Q: Is taxing unrealized gains constitutional?**

A: Yes. The 16th Amendment says "income from whatever source derived." Congress defines income. Congress already taxes unrealized gains in multiple situations. *Moore v. United States* (2024) explicitly declined to rule that unrealized gains cannot be income.

**Q: What about liquidity? Can billionaires actually pay?**

A: Absolutely. Billionaires have unlimited access to credit—that's literally how "buy, borrow, die" works. If you can borrow billions against your assets to fund your lifestyle, you can borrow to pay your taxes. Plus: 10-year installment option available.

**Q: Won't billionaires just leave the country?**

A: We include a 40% exit tax on unrealized gains for anyone who expatriates to avoid the wealth tax. You can leave, but you'll pay on your way out.

**Q: Will this hurt the economy?**

A: No. Billionaires don't create jobs—consumer demand does. Wealth concentration actually *hurts* the economy by concentrating purchasing power and reducing broad-based consumption. Taxing billionaires to fund public investment is economically beneficial.

**Q: Isn't this just jealousy?**

A: No. This is about fairness. Why should a teacher pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett? Why should the rules allow infinite wealth accumulation tax-free while working families pay their share? A functioning society requires everyone to contribute.

## TALKING POINTS

**"Billionaires already pay the most in taxes!"**
> False. They pay the most in *dollar amount* because they have the most money. But their *rate*—the percentage of income/wealth they pay—is lower than a middle-class family. Warren Buffett himself says this is unfair.

**"This is socialism!"**
> No, it's capitalism with rules. The tax code was written by and for the wealthy. We're simply making billionaires play by the same rules as everyone else. Paying your fair share isn't socialism—it's citizenship.

**"The wealthy earned their money!"**
> No one earns a billion dollars. They accumulate it through systems—infrastructure, educated workers, courts, contracts—paid for by everyone. The billionaire minimum tax is simply asking them to pay back into the system that made their wealth possible.

**"They'll just avoid it!"**
> We close the loopholes. Exit tax for expatriation. Mark-to-market for tradable assets. IRS enforcement surge. The game-playing ends.

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Billionaires have rigged the tax code to pay lower rates than working families. The Billionaire Minimum Tax ends "buy, borrow, die" and ensures the ultra-wealthy pay at least 30-35% on their true economic income—still less than many workers pay, but a massive improvement over zero.**

**This isn't radical. This is fair. And it raises $25-40 billion annually to fund healthcare, housing, and education for everyone.**
