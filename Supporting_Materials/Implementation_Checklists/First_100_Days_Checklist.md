## ⚠️ OBSTACLES & CONTINGENCIES

**Congressional Obstruction:**
- **If Senate filibuster blocks legislation:**
  - Reform/eliminate filibuster for democracy bills
  - Use budget reconciliation where possible
  - Maximize executive action
- **Backup:** Executive orders can accomplish 40% of agenda without Congress

**Legal Challenges:**
- **If courts block executive actions:**
  - Have DOJ defend vigorously
  - Prepare alternative approaches
  - Build public pressure on courts
- **Backup:** Most executive actions on solid legal ground (reverting to pre-2025 status)

**Media Opposition:**
- **If right-wing media attacks as "overreach":**
  - Frame as restoration, not expansion
  - Contrast with Project 2025 actual overreach
  - Use Fairness Doctrine to balance coverage
- **Strategy:** Bypass traditional media with direct communication (social, town halls)

**Staff/Capacity Shortages:**
- **If can't hire fast enough:**
  - Prioritize critical positions (DOJ, civil rights, voting)
  - Use detailees from other agencies
  - Contract support where appropriate
