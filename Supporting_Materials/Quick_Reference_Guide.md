## 💬 KEY TALKING POINTS

**"Why do we need this?"**
→ Project 2025 proved massive change is possible. They changed America in the wrong direction. We'll change it in the right direction—toward democracy, not authoritarianism.

**"Is this radical?"**
→ By American standards, yes. By global standards, no. Every developed democracy has universal healthcare. Most have public election funding. None allow unlimited corporate money in politics. We're not inventing democracy—we're catching up to it.

**"Can we afford it?"**
→ We can't afford NOT to. Current system costs MORE (healthcare alone). Plus, wealth tax and financial transaction tax raise $675B—more than enough. And democracy isn't a budget line item—it's the foundation of everything else.

**"Is this realistic?"**
→ Trump proved with Project 2025 that comprehensive transformation is possible in short time. It just takes will. These reforms have 60-70% public support. The question isn't feasibility—it's whether we have the courage.

**"Won't this help Democrats?"**
→ These reforms help DEMOCRACY, not parties. Ranked-choice voting helps third parties. Anti-corruption helps everyone. Fair districts create competition. We're fixing the system, not rigging it.

**"What's the first priority?"**
→ Year 1: Pass immediately achievable reforms (lobbying limits, public funding, ethics body, voting rights, RCV mandate). Build momentum. Then tackle constitutional amendments (5-10 year campaigns).

## ✊ THE BOTTOM LINE

**America is at a crossroads.**

Project 2025 showed democracy can be hijacked. **Project 2029 ensures it can't happen again.**

These aren't just policy proposals. **This is a blueprint for the democracy we've never had but always promised:**
- Of the people (not corporations)
- By the people (not lobbyists)
- For the people (not the wealthy)

**Your 20 reforms are the DNA of democratic renewal.**

**Democracy requires eternal vigilance. This is our answer.**

**Now let's build it.** 🇺🇸
