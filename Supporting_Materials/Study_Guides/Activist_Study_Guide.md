**As a group:**
1. List your top 3 reform priorities
2. For each, answer:
   - Why does this matter to us?
   - Who are potential allies?
   - What's a winnable first campaign?

---

## WEEK 3: BUILD YOUR ORGANIZING PLAN

### Components of Successful Campaign:

**1. CLEAR GOAL**
- Specific, measurable, achievable, time-bound

  - "Pass automatic voter registration in our state by November 2025"
  - "Get 10 Congressional candidates to pledge support for Citizens United reversal by primary season"
  - "Convince our city to implement free public transit pilot by 2026"

**2. TARGET**
- Who has power to give you what you want?
- Examples:
  - State legislators (for state-level reforms)
  - Members of Congress (for federal reforms)
  - City council (for local pilots)
  - Candidates (for pledges and commitments)
- Research: What's their current position? What moves them? (Voters? Donors? Ideology?)

**3. TACTICS**

**Spectrum of Tactics (choose multiple):**

**Low-Intensity (Build Base):**
- Social media campaigns
- Petition drives
- Educational events (film screenings, teach-ins)
- Tabling at community events

**Medium-Intensity (Apply Pressure):**
- Town hall bird-dogging (ask tough questions publicly)
- Phone/email/letter campaigns to representatives
- Lobby days (visit offices, in-district meetings)
- Op-eds and letters to editor
- Candidate forums (make this an issue)

**High-Intensity (Escalate):**
- Primary challenges (run against opponents)
- Protests and rallies
- Direct action (sit-ins, banner drops, creative disruption)

  - Campaign finance: Every Voice, RepresentUs, Move to Amend, labor unions
  - Civic education: Teachers unions, PTAs, education advocates
  - Tech accountability: Mozilla, EFF, tech ethics groups

**5. TIMELINE**
- Break campaign into phases:
  - Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Build base, educate, recruit

  - Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Escalate, deliver win or pivot
- Set milestones: "By March: 1,000 petition signatures. By June: Meet with 10 legislators. By December: Vote or pledge."

**6. RESOURCES**

---

### Activity: Draft Your Campaign Plan

**Answer these questions (write them down):**

1. **Goal:** What do we want to achieve, specifically, by when?
2. **Target:** Who has the power to give us this? Name names.
3. **Tactics:** What 5-10 tactics will we use? (mix of low/medium/high intensity)
4. **Coalition:** Who are 3-5 potential partners? Have we reached out?
5. **Timeline:** What are our milestones for Months 1, 3, 6, and 12?
6. **Resources:** What do we need? What do we have? What's the gap?
7. **Messaging:** What are our 3 core messages? Test them with 10 people.
8. **Communications:** What's our social media plan? Email plan? Press plan?

**Refine this plan over Week 3. Get feedback. Adjust. Commit.**

---

### First Month Tactics:

**Build Base:**
- 2-3 educational events (film screening, teach-in, guest speaker)
- Door-to-door canvassing in target neighborhoods
- Tabling at community events (farmers market, festivals, etc.)
- Social media content: 3-5 posts/week (education, inspiration, calls to action)

**Apply Pressure:**
- Phone bank to target legislators (100+ calls/week)
- Office visits (in-district meetings with staff or member)
- Town hall bird-dogging (ask public questions, record responses, share online)
- Op-ed submitted to local paper

**Build Coalition:**
- Reach out to 5-10 potential partner organizations
- Offer to table at their events
- Co-host an educational event
- Cross-promote on social media

**Metrics:**
- Track: Petition signatures, volunteer recruits, social media followers, press hits, meetings with targets
- Goal: Double your base every month (10 → 20 → 40 → 80...)

---

## LONG-TERM: SUSTAIN AND SCALE

### Months 2-6: Escalate

**Build Power:**
- Every volunteer recruits 2 more → exponential growth
- Launch phonebanking and texting programs (scale up contact)
- Fundraise (small-dollar donations from base)
- Leadership development (identify and train new leaders)

**Increase Pressure:**
- Move from education to confrontation (if targets unresponsive)
- Protests/rallies (if needed—visual, media-getting)
- Primary challenge threat (if incumbent opposes reform)
- Electoral work (if elections coming—make this THE issue)

**Win or Pivot:**
- If winning: Push for final victory (vote, pledge, policy change)
- If stalled: Escalate tactics or pivot strategy
- If losing: Learn lessons, regroup, try different approach or target

---

### Months 6-12: Deliver Victory or Build for Next Cycle

**Possible Outcomes:**

**Victory:**
- State/local reform passed (AVR, RCV, public financing, etc.)
- Candidate pledges secured (Congressional candidates commit)
- Awareness raised massively (issue is now on agenda)
- **Celebrate, publicize, replicate** (help other areas win too)

**Partial Victory:**
- Compromise achieved (not everything, but progress)
- Issue is now mainstream (next legislature/admin will address)
- Base built (you have organization now for next fight)
- **Consolidate gains, prepare for next phase**

**Stalemate or Loss:**
- Target didn't move or moved wrong direction
- **Learn lessons:** What worked? What didn't? Why?
- **Regroup:** Different tactics? Different target? Different coalition?
- **Pivot:** Focus on electoral (replace opponent) or move to different venue (state vs. local vs. federal)
- **Build for long-term:** This is generational work—losses are learning

---

### Year 2+: Sustain the Movement

**Avoid Burnout:**
- Rotate leadership (don't rely on one person)
- Celebrate small wins (not just final victory)
- Self-care and community care (this is marathon, not sprint)
- Fun! (Social events, music, art, joy—not just grinding)

**Institutionalize:**
- Form formal organization (501c3 or c4 if scaling up)
- Hire staff (if you raise enough money)
- Establish regular meetings and structures
- Document lessons learned (so new people can plug in)

**Scale:**
- Help other communities launch campaigns (share resources)
- Coordinate statewide or nationally (if reform is federal)
- Join national coalitions (link local to national efforts)

**Electoral:**
- If reform requires federal action: Elect champions to Congress, Presidency
- Make Project 2029 reforms a litmus test (candidates must commit)
- Primary challenges for opponents (or electoral support for champions)
- 2026, 2028, 2030... make these reforms THE issue

---

## ORGANIZING BEST PRACTICES

### Dos:

✅ **Start small:** Better to have 10 committed people than 100 passively interested
✅ **Be specific:** Clear goals, clear targets, clear tactics
✅ **Build relationships:** Organizing is about people, not just issues
✅ **Center those most affected:** Voting rights = center BIPOC communities. Economic justice = center working class.
✅ **Embrace tension:** Change requires conflict. Don't shy away from confrontation (but be strategic).
✅ **Celebrate:** Wins, losses, milestones—mark them. Build culture and morale.
✅ **Tell stories:** Personal stories move people more than statistics
✅ **Train leaders:** Invest in developing new organizers—movement must grow
✅ **Be patient and persistent:** This is generational work. Don't give up after one setback.

### Don'ts:

❌ **Don't be vague:** "Raise awareness" is not a goal. What specific change do you want?
❌ **Don't do it alone:** Coalition is everything. Partner, don't compete.
❌ **Don't wait for perfection:** Launch before you're ready. Iterate in public.
❌ **Don't ignore power:** If your tactics don't create pressure, you're just making noise.
❌ **Don't be mean:** Fierce and loving > vicious and hateful. Organize with dignity.
❌ **Don't burn out leaders:** Rotate responsibilities. No martyrs.
❌ **Don't ignore electoral:** Policy wins require political power. Elect champions.
❌ **Don't give up:** Losses are lessons. Regroup and try again.

## FINAL THOUGHTS: YOU CAN DO THIS

**Democracy is not a spectator sport.**

These reforms won't pass themselves. **They require organized people demanding change.**

You don't need to be an expert. You don't need permission. You don't need a huge budget.

**You need:**
- A few committed people
- A clear goal
- A target with power
- Tactics that create pressure
- Persistence

**Start small. Start local. Start now.**

Every movement started with a handful of people who decided to act.

**You are enough. Your community is enough.**

**Organize. Mobilize. Win. 🔥**
