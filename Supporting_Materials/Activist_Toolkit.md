## 📞 I. CALL SCRIPTS

### **Script 1: Call Your Representative - General Democracy Reform**

**[Use this when calling your Member of Congress about Project 2029 reforms]**

---

**Introduction:**
"Hi, my name is [YOUR NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP CODE]. I'm calling to urge [REPRESENTATIVE'S NAME] to support comprehensive democracy reforms."

**The Ask:**
"Specifically, I want [him/her/them] to co-sponsor legislation to:
- [CHOOSE 1-2 SPECIFIC REFORMS]:
  - Overturn Citizens United through a constitutional amendment
  - Pass automatic voter registration
  - Ban congressional stock trading
  - Establish publicly funded elections
  - [Other reform from Project 2029]"

**Personal Story (if applicable):**
"This matters to me because [BRIEF PERSONAL CONNECTION - 1-2 sentences]:
- Example: 'I couldn't vote in the last election because registration was too complicated'
- Example: 'I'm tired of seeing billionaires buy our elections'
- Example: 'My community needs representatives who work for us, not lobbyists'"

**Closing:**
"Can I count on [REPRESENTATIVE'S NAME] to support these democracy reforms? And can you tell me [his/her/their] current position on [specific reform]?"

**If they say yes:** "Thank you! How can I follow up to track progress on this?"

**If they say no or are non-committal:** "I'm disappointed to hear that. I'll be watching [his/her/their] votes closely and will remember this when it's time to vote."

**End:** "Thank you for your time. Can I get your name for my records?"

---

### **Script 2: Call Your Senator - Citizens United Amendment**

**Introduction:**
"Hi, my name is [YOUR NAME], a constituent from [CITY], and I'm calling to urge Senator [NAME] to co-sponsor a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United."

**The Problem:**
"The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision has allowed unlimited corporate money to flood our elections. This is corrupting our democracy and drowning out regular voters' voices."

**The Solution:**
"A constitutional amendment establishing that:
1. Corporations are not people and don't have constitutional rights to spend unlimited money in elections
2. Congress and states have the power to regulate campaign spending
3. Money is not speech, and spending limits don't violate the First Amendment"

**The Ask:**
"Will Senator [NAME] commit to co-sponsoring a Citizens United amendment? This has broad bipartisan support from voters - over 70% of Americans want to overturn Citizens United."

**Closing:**
"Can you tell me the Senator's position on this? And how can I follow up?"

"Thank you. My name again is [YOUR NAME] from [CITY]. I'll be watching the Senator's actions on this closely."

---

### **Script 3: Call State Legislator - Automatic Voter Registration**

**Introduction:**
"Hello, I'm [YOUR NAME] from [DISTRICT/CITY], and I'm calling to ask [REPRESENTATIVE/SENATOR NAME] to support automatic voter registration in our state."

**The Problem:**
"Right now, millions of eligible voters in [STATE] aren't registered because the process is complicated and confusing. This suppresses turnout and makes our elections less representative."

**The Solution:**
"Automatic voter registration would register every eligible citizen when they interact with the DMV or other state agencies. It:
- Increases voter participation by 30%+
- Saves money (cheaper than current system)
- Reduces errors
- Works in 21 states already, including Republican and Democratic states"

**The Ask:**
"Will [REPRESENTATIVE/SENATOR NAME] support automatic voter registration legislation this session?"

**Closing:**
"Can you tell me their position? This is a voting issue for me - I'll be tracking who supports expanding access to the ballot."

## ✉️ II. EMAIL TEMPLATES

### **Template 1: Email to Representative - Multiple Reforms**

**Subject:** Constituent Request: Support Democracy Reform Package

---

**Body:**

Dear [Representative/Senator] [LAST NAME],

I am writing as your constituent from [CITY/ZIP] to urge you to support comprehensive democracy reforms that will restore government accountability and ensure every American's voice is heard.

Our democracy faces serious threats:
- Unlimited money from billionaires and corporations dominates elections
- Gerrymandering allows politicians to choose their voters instead of voters choosing representatives
- Millions of eligible voters face barriers to registration and voting
- Lobbyists have more influence than constituents

**I urge you to co-sponsor and support legislation to:**

1. **Overturn Citizens United** - Constitutional amendment establishing that money is not speech and corporations aren't people

2. **Ban Gerrymandering** - Require independent redistricting commissions in all states

3. **Automatic Voter Registration** - Register all eligible citizens automatically when they interact with government agencies

4. **Publicly Funded Elections** - Establish Democracy Vouchers and small-donor matching to empower ordinary citizens

5. **Independent Congressional Ethics Body** - Create external ethics enforcement with teeth

**These reforms have broad public support** - 65-75% of Americans across party lines support these changes. This isn't partisan; it's about ensuring our government works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected.

**I request a response detailing your position on each of these reforms.** I will be tracking your votes and statements on democracy reform, and this will inform my vote in the next election.

Thank you for your service. I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

[YOUR FULL NAME]

### **Template 2: Email to Local Newspaper - Letter to the Editor**

**Subject:** Letter to the Editor - Democracy Reforms Needed

---

**Body:**

Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my strong support for comprehensive democracy reforms to address the crisis of money in politics and voter suppression.

[CHOOSE YOUR FOCUS - personalize this section:]

**Option A - Money in Politics:**
The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision has allowed billionaires and corporations to spend unlimited sums to influence our elections. This is not what the Founders intended. When a single wealthy donor can contribute more than thousands of ordinary citizens combined, our democracy becomes an oligarchy.

**Option B - Voting Rights:**
Too many Americans face unnecessary barriers to voting. Complicated registration processes, limited early voting, and voter ID laws disproportionately affect working people, students, and communities of color. Automatic voter registration and expanded early voting would ensure every eligible citizen can participate.

**Option C - Gerrymandering:**
Politicians in [STATE] have drawn district lines to guarantee their re-election, regardless of voters' preferences. Independent redistricting commissions would end this anti-democratic practice and make our representatives actually representative.

[YOUR CALL TO ACTION:]
I urge [REPRESENTATIVE'S NAME] and [SENATOR'S NAME] to support:
- [Specific reform 1]
- [Specific reform 2]
- [Specific reform 3]

Our democracy depends on elected officials who put constituents above donors and partisanship. It's time to restore government of, by, and for the people.

Sincerely,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR CITY]

### **Sample Letter: Support Citizens United Amendment**

```
Jane Doe
123 Main Street
Springfield, IL 62701
October 22, 2025

The Honorable John Smith
U.S. House of Representatives
1234 Longworth House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515

Dear Representative Smith:

I am writing as your constituent from Springfield (ZIP 62701) to urge you to co-sponsor H.J.Res. [NUMBER] proposing a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision.

The Citizens United ruling has fundamentally corrupted our democracy. In the 2024 election cycle, the top 100 donors contributed more to campaigns than 2 million small donors combined. This is not what the Founders intended when they established a government "of the people, by the people, for the people."

I am a small business owner in Springfield, and I see firsthand how corporate lobbying and unlimited campaign spending skew policy in favor of big corporations at the expense of local businesses and working families. When a billionaire can spend more on a single election than our entire community contributes combined, my voice—and the voices of thousands of your constituents—is drowned out.

A constitutional amendment is necessary because the Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment in a way that prevents Congress from addressing this problem through legislation. An amendment would:
1. Establish that corporations do not have the same constitutional rights as people
2. Affirm that Congress and states have the power to regulate campaign spending
3. Clarify that money is not speech and spending limits are constitutional

This reform has overwhelming support among your constituents—polls show 75% of Americans want to overturn Citizens United. This is not a partisan issue; it's about ensuring our government works for all of us, not just the wealthiest donors.

I urge you to co-sponsor H.J.Res. [NUMBER] and to make overturning Citizens United a top priority. Please respond to this letter detailing your position on this amendment. I will be tracking your votes and statements on this issue, and it will significantly influence my vote in the next election.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
Jane Doe

## 🎤 V. TOWN HALL BIRD-DOGGING QUESTIONS

### **How to Bird-Dog Effectively**

**Bird-dogging** = Asking tough, pointed questions at public events and recording the response

**Preparation:**
1. Research your representative's positions
2. Prepare 1-2 specific questions
3. Coordinate with others (multiple related questions = more pressure)
4. Bring recording device (phone video)
5. Plan to share response on social media

**Delivery Tips:**
- Be respectful but firm
- Ask specific yes/no questions
- Don't accept vague non-answers
- Follow up if they dodge
- Thank them for their time (even if answer is bad)

---

### **Sample Questions by Reform**

**Money in Politics:**

"Representative [NAME], you received [$AMOUNT] from [INDUSTRY] PACs last cycle. How can voters trust you to regulate that industry? Will you commit to rejecting corporate PAC money?"

"Senator [NAME], will you commit to co-sponsoring a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United? Yes or no?"

"Over 70% of Americans want to get money out of politics. Will you support publicly funded elections so regular people—not billionaires—can run for office?"

---

**Voting Rights:**

"Representative [NAME], [NUMBER] eligible voters in our district aren't registered. Will you support automatic voter registration to ensure every eligible citizen can vote?"

"Why did you vote against making Election Day a federal holiday? Don't you want more people to vote?"

"Gerrymandering in our state means only 10% of seats are competitive. Will you support independent redistricting commissions?"

---

**Congressional Ethics:**

"Senator [NAME], you traded stocks in [INDUSTRY] just before voting on legislation affecting that industry. Will you support banning congressional stock trading?"

"You became a lobbyist less than a year after leaving Congress. Don't you think there should be stronger cooling-off periods to prevent the revolving door?"

---

**Electoral Reform:**

"Representative [NAME], you lost the popular vote in our state but won because of gerrymandering. Do you think that's democratic?"

"Will you support ranked-choice voting so voters can support third-party candidates without 'spoiling' elections?"

---

**Follow-Up Questions (when they dodge):**

- "That's not what I asked. Let me repeat: [YES OR NO QUESTION]"
- "Can you explain why you voted [AGAINST/FOR] this when [STAT% OF CONSTITUENTS] support it?"
- "Will you commit to a public meeting to discuss this with constituents?"
- "So you're saying you won't support [REFORM]? Can you look me in the eye and tell voters why?"

**Example: Citizens United Amendment Petition**

**Title:**
"Congress: Pass a Constitutional Amendment to Overturn Citizens United"

**To:** Members of the United States Congress

**We, the undersigned citizens, call on Congress to propose a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United v. FEC decision.**

The Citizens United decision has unleashed a flood of unlimited money into our elections, allowing corporations and billionaires to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. In the 2024 election cycle, just 100 donors contributed more to campaigns than 2 million small donors combined. This is not democracy—it's oligarchy.

70% of Americans across party lines want to overturn Citizens United. The corrupting influence of money in politics undermines public trust, skews policy in favor of wealthy donors, and makes it nearly impossible for ordinary people to run for office or have their voices heard.

A constitutional amendment would restore democracy by:
1. Establishing that corporations are not people and don't have constitutional rights to spend unlimited money in elections
2. Affirming that Congress and states have the power to regulate campaign spending
3. Clarifying that money is not speech and that spending limits don't violate the First Amendment

**Therefore, we call on Congress to:**
1. Propose a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United
2. Pass it with a 2/3 vote in both chambers
3. Send it to the states for ratification

We will be tracking every member's vote and statement on this amendment. Your position on this issue will determine our votes in the next election.

Sincerely,
[Signers]

Example: "Local Organizers Launch Campaign for Automatic Voter Registration"

[CITY, STATE] – [Opening paragraph answers: Who, What, When, Where, Why]

Example: "A coalition of Springfield residents and democracy reform organizations today launched a campaign calling on State Senator Jane Smith to support automatic voter registration legislation. The campaign includes a petition, phone banking, and a rally scheduled for November 15 at the State Capitol."

[Second paragraph - The Problem/Context]

Example: "Over 50,000 eligible voters in Springfield are not registered, largely due to the confusing and burdensome registration process.

[Third paragraph - The Solution/Your Campaign]

Example: "The campaign, organized under the banner of Project 2029, aims to collect 5,000 petition signatures, generate 1,000+ phone calls to Senator Smith's office, and mobilize hundreds of constituents to the November 15 rally. 'Every eligible citizen deserves the right to vote, and automatic registration removes unnecessary barriers,' said [YOUR NAME], lead organizer."

[Fourth paragraph - Quote from organizer or supporter]

Example: "'When I turned 18, I didn't know how to register to vote. I missed my first chance to vote because the process was too confusing.

## 💰 X. FUNDRAISING TOOLS

### **Fundraising Ask Email Template**

**Subject:** Help Us Fight for Democracy - [CAMPAIGN NAME]

---

**Body:**

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I'm reaching out because I need your help with something important.

[PERSONAL CONNECTION / WHY YOU'RE INVOLVED:]
Example: "Three months ago, I watched as my state legislature drew district lines that guarantee one party's control for the next decade, regardless of how people vote. I decided I couldn't sit by anymore."

**We're organizing a campaign to [SPECIFIC GOAL]:**
- [What you're doing]
- [Why it matters]
- [What you've accomplished so far]

**But we need resources to:**
- Print 5,000 flyers to distribute across the district
- Rent space for a town hall on [DATE]
- Buy phone banking software to reach 10,000 voters
- [Other specific needs]

**Can you chip in $10, $25, $50, or whatever you can afford?**

[DONATE BUTTON / LINK]

Here's the truth: We're being outspent 100-to-1 by the other side. But we have something they don't—people power. Every $10 helps us reach 50 more voters. Every $50 prints 200 flyers. Every $100 pays for phone banking software for a week.

**Even if you can only give $5, it matters.** Grassroots campaigns are funded $5, $10, $25 at a time.

[DONATE BUTTON / LINK]

If you can't donate, here are other ways to help:
- Share this email with 3 friends
- Volunteer for [SPECIFIC TASK]
- Attend our event on [DATE]

Thank you for being part of this movement.

Together, we can restore democracy.
