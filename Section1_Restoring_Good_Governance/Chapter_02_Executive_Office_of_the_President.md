# Chapter 2: Executive Office of the President

## Executive Summary

The Executive Office of the President (EOP) comprises the institutional apparatus that supports presidential decision-making and coordinates executive branch operations. When functioning properly, EOP offices provide expert analysis, facilitate interagency coordination, and ensure that presidential decisions are informed by professional expertise and constrained by law. Project 2025's blueprint for the EOP—authored by Russ Vought, Trump's former Director of the Office of Management and Budget—proposes transforming these professional institutions into weapons of presidential will, explicitly calling for efforts to "bend or break the bureaucracy" to serve partisan political objectives.

Vought's chapter reveals Project 2025's core strategy: weaponize the Office of Management and Budget as "air-traffic control" to control all federal agencies, politicize budget and regulatory processes, and eliminate professional expertise that might constrain presidential power. The document states:

**"The great challenge confronting a conservative President is the existential need for aggressive use of the vast powers of the executive branch to return power...Success in meeting that challenge will require a rare combination of boldness and self-denial: boldness to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will."** (Project 2025, p. 44)

This explicit call to "bend or break" professional government reveals the authoritarian nature of Project 2025's agenda. Key EOP proposals that threaten democratic governance include:

**OMB Weaponization:** Project 2025 directs that OMB serve as the instrument of presidential control over agencies, with the Director acting as "the best, most comprehensive approximation of the President's mind as it pertains to the policy agenda" (Project 2025, p. 45). Political appointees (Program Associate Directors or PADs) would sign all budget apportionments, replacing career professionals (Deputy Associate Directors or DADs) who previously performed this technical function. This politicizes fiscal controls, enabling OMB to withhold congressionally appropriated funds from agencies that resist presidential directives.

**Professional Expertise Eliminated:** The document characterizes career professionals as obstacles protecting "the status quo" and directs appointment of political loyalists "creative and fearless" in challenging "legal precedents that serve to protect the status quo" (Project 2025, p. 46). This explicitly subordinates professional judgment and legal compliance to political objectives.

**OIRA Weaponization:** The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, designed to ensure regulatory proposals are supported by evidence and cost-benefit analysis, would become a political enforcement arm killing regulations that conflict with conservative ideology regardless of statutory requirements or empirical evidence.

**NSC Politicization:** Project 2025 calls for "staffing the vast majority of NSC directorates with aligned political appointees" (Project 2025 quote from NSC section), excluding career foreign service officers and intelligence analysts from national security decision-making.

**Transparency Eliminated:** The blueprint makes no provision for public access, congressional oversight, or transparency in EOP operations. All mechanisms operate in secret to advance "the President's agenda" without accountability.

Project 2029's Democratic Renewal Agenda restores the EOP to its constitutional role: providing expert analysis to inform presidential decision-making while ensuring legal compliance and public accountability. Our comprehensive framework includes:

- **Immediate executive action** restoring professional standards, scientific integrity, and transparency across all EOP offices
- **Legislative codification** of EOP independence and professional requirements
- **Institutional reforms** embedding career expertise in policy processes
- **Ethics and oversight** mechanisms ensuring accountability
- **Regulatory processes** based on evidence, not ideology

The Executive Office of the President should serve the American people by ensuring informed, lawful, and accountable governance. Project 2025 would transform it into an instrument of presidential authoritarianism. This chapter provides the roadmap to prevent that outcome and restore professional EOP operations.

## The Project 2025 Damage Assessment

### What Project 2025 Did
- Expanded executive power beyond constitutional limits
- Undermined Office of Management and Budget (OMB) independence
- Politicized Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)
- Weakened Council of Economic Advisers
- Undermined National Security Council processes
- Eliminated or weakened oversight offices

### Impact on Democratic Governance
- Concentration of unchecked power
- Erosion of expert-driven policy
- Lack of transparency in decision-making
- Weakened checks and balances

## Immediate Reversal Actions (Days 1-100)

### Day One Executive Orders
1. Restore OMB and OIRA independence and integrity
2. Rebuild National Security Council processes
3. Restore oversight mechanisms
4. Implement transparency requirements

### First 100 Days Priorities
- Reconstitute advisory councils and expert bodies
- Restore scientific integrity to policy processes
- Rebuild interagency coordination mechanisms
- Implement robust ethics and transparency standards
