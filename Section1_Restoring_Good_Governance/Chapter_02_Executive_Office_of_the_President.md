# Chapter 2: Executive Office of the President

## Executive Summary

The Executive Office of the President (EOP) comprises the institutional apparatus that supports presidential decision-making and coordinates executive branch operations. When functioning properly, EOP offices provide expert analysis, facilitate interagency coordination, and ensure that presidential decisions are informed by professional expertise and constrained by law. Project 2025's blueprint for the EOP—authored by Russ Vought, Trump's former Director of the Office of Management and Budget—proposes transforming these professional institutions into weapons of presidential will, explicitly calling for efforts to "bend or break the bureaucracy" to serve partisan political objectives.

Vought's chapter reveals Project 2025's core strategy: weaponize the Office of Management and Budget as "air-traffic control" to control all federal agencies, politicize budget and regulatory processes, and eliminate professional expertise that might constrain presidential power. The document states:

**"The great challenge confronting a conservative President is the existential need for aggressive use of the vast powers of the executive branch to return power...Success in meeting that challenge will require a rare combination of boldness and self-denial: boldness to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will."** (Project 2025, p. 44)

This explicit call to "bend or break" professional government reveals the authoritarian nature of Project 2025's agenda. Key EOP proposals that threaten democratic governance include:

**OMB Weaponization:** Project 2025 directs that OMB serve as the instrument of presidential control over agencies, with the Director acting as "the best, most comprehensive approximation of the President's mind as it pertains to the policy agenda" (Project 2025, p. 45). Political appointees (Program Associate Directors or PADs) would sign all budget apportionments, replacing career professionals (Deputy Associate Directors or DADs) who previously performed this technical function. This politicizes fiscal controls, enabling OMB to withhold congressionally appropriated funds from agencies that resist presidential directives.

**Professional Expertise Eliminated:** The document characterizes career professionals as obstacles protecting "the status quo" and directs appointment of political loyalists "creative and fearless" in challenging "legal precedents that serve to protect the status quo" (Project 2025, p. 46). This explicitly subordinates professional judgment and legal compliance to political objectives.

**OIRA Weaponization:** The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, designed to ensure regulatory proposals are supported by evidence and cost-benefit analysis, would become a political enforcement arm killing regulations that conflict with conservative ideology regardless of statutory requirements or empirical evidence.

**NSC Politicization:** Project 2025 calls for "staffing the vast majority of NSC directorates with aligned political appointees" (Project 2025 quote from NSC section), excluding career foreign service officers and intelligence analysts from national security decision-making.

**Transparency Eliminated:** The blueprint makes no provision for public access, congressional oversight, or transparency in EOP operations. All mechanisms operate in secret to advance "the President's agenda" without accountability.

Project 2029's Democratic Renewal Agenda restores the EOP to its constitutional role: providing expert analysis to inform presidential decision-making while ensuring legal compliance and public accountability. Our comprehensive framework includes:

- **Immediate executive action** restoring professional standards, scientific integrity, and transparency across all EOP offices
- **Legislative codification** of EOP independence and professional requirements
- **Institutional reforms** embedding career expertise in policy processes
- **Ethics and oversight** mechanisms ensuring accountability
- **Regulatory processes** based on evidence, not ideology

The Executive Office of the President should serve the American people by ensuring informed, lawful, and accountable governance. Project 2025 would transform it into an instrument of presidential authoritarianism. This chapter provides the roadmap to prevent that outcome and restore professional EOP operations.

## Constitutional and Legal Framework

### Constitutional Limits on Executive Power

The Constitution establishes a system of separated powers with checks and balances, not unconstrained presidential authority. The Executive Office of the President operates within constitutional bounds that Project 2025 systematically violated.

**Article II, Section 1 - Executive Power Clause:**
"The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America."

**Constitutional Interpretation:**
- Executive power means faithful execution of laws, not power to nullify or ignore statutes
- President must "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" (Art. II, § 3)
- No authority to withhold appropriated funds (Impoundment Control Act, Train v. City of New York, 1975)
- No authority to override statutory requirements through executive fiat

**Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952):**
Justice Jackson's concurrence establishes three-tier framework for presidential power:
1. **Maximum authority:** President acts with congressional authorization
2. **Zone of twilight:** President acts where Congress silent - shared authority
3. **Lowest ebb:** President acts contrary to congressional will - presumptively unconstitutional

**Application to Project 2025 EOP Abuses:**
- OMB withholding appropriated funds = Category 3 (lowest ebb) - **unconstitutional**
- OIRA killing regulations required by statute = Category 3 - **unconstitutional**
- Politicizing career positions protected by civil service laws = Category 3 - **unconstitutional**

**Article II, Section 3 - Take Care Clause:**
The President "shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed"

**Constitutional Requirement:**
- President must enforce statutes even when disagreeing with policy
- Cannot refuse to enforce duly enacted laws
- Cannot instruct agencies to violate statutory mandates
- Professional civil service is mechanism ensuring faithful execution

**Project 2025 Violations:**
- Directing OIRA to kill regulations statutorily mandated (Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act)
- Instructing OMB to withhold funds appropriated by Congress
- Ordering agencies to ignore statutory deadlines and requirements
- Politicizing career positions to replace professionals with loyalists who ignore law

**Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 - Appropriations Clause:**
"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law"

**Constitutional Requirement:**
- Congress controls the purse
- President cannot refuse to spend appropriated funds
- Impoundment Control Act (2 U.S.C. §§ 681-688) codifies this constitutional command

**Project 2025 Violations:**
- OMB withheld funds from agencies that resisted political direction
- DOGE (unofficial body) directed impoundment without legal authority
- Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act systematically violated
- GAO findings of illegal impoundment ignored

**Fifth Amendment - Due Process:**
"No person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"

**Application to Civil Service:**
- Federal employees have property interest in continued employment (Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972))
- Schedule F removals without hearing violate due process
- Political loyalty tests violate First Amendment (Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976))
- Merit-based civil service is constitutional safeguard against patronage corruption

**First Amendment - Freedom of Speech/Association:**
- Government employees retain speech and association rights
- Cannot be fired for political affiliation (Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507 (1980))
- Schedule F political loyalty tests violate First Amendment
- Whistleblower protections are First Amendment safeguard

### Statutory Framework for EOP Reform

**Congressional Authority - Article I Legislative Power:**

Congress has plenary authority to structure executive branch operations, limit presidential power, and require professional standards for EOP offices. This authority is grounded in:

1. **Necessary and Proper Clause (Art. I, § 8, cl. 18):** Congress may enact laws "necessary and proper" for executing federal powers
2. **Appropriations Power (Art. I, § 9, cl. 7):** Congress controls federal spending and may condition funds on compliance
3. **Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq.):** Establishes requirements for federal rulemaking and agency action
4. **Civil Service Reform Act (5 U.S.C. Chapter 23):** Codifies merit-based civil service protections

**Key Statutes Violated by Project 2025:**

- **Restoration requirement:** Reinstate IGs, criminal penalties for violations

**4. Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act (5 U.S.C. Chapter 71)**
- Protects federal employee union rights
- Executive Orders 13836, 13837, 13839 violated statutory collective bargaining rights
- **Restoration requirement:** Rescind anti-union executive orders, restore union rights

**5. Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8))**
- Prohibits retaliation against federal employees who report wrongdoing
- Systematically violated through Schedule F retaliation
- **Restoration requirement:** Reinstate whistleblowers, enhanced protections

### Legal Basis for EOP Reforms

**Congressional Authority to Restructure EOP:**

The Executive Office of the President was created by Congress through the Reorganization Act of 1939. Congress retains plenary authority to:
- Define EOP office structures and responsibilities
- Require professional qualifications for EOP positions
- Mandate transparency and reporting requirements
- Establish ethical standards and oversight mechanisms
- Appropriate funds conditionally on compliance with standards

**Precedents Establishing Congressional EOP Authority:**

1. **Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935)**
   - Congress may limit President's removal power for officials performing quasi-legislative/judicial functions
   - Establishes independent agencies insulated from presidential control
   - **Application:** OIRA Director could be given for-cause removal protection

2. **Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988)**
   - Upheld independent counsel with limited presidential removal authority
   - President's removal power not unlimited even for executive branch officials
   - **Application:** Inspector General protections are constitutional

3. **Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 140 S. Ct. 2183 (2020)**
   - Struck down for-cause removal protection for single-director independent agency
   - Distinguished multi-member boards and commissions with bipartisan requirements
   - **Application:** Multi-member oversight boards (e.g., reformed OIRA commission) constitutional

**Legal Authorities Supporting Specific Reforms:**

- Congressional authority to require career representation on NSC staff

**Scientific Integrity:**
- America COMPETES Reauthorization Act (42 U.S.C. § 6620): Requires scientific integrity policies
- Data Quality Act (44 U.S.C. § 3516): Requires quality, objectivity, utility, integrity of information

### Legislative Strategy and Timing

**Phase 1 (Days 1-100): Emergency Legislation**
- Office of Management and Budget Independence Act (prevent impoundment crisis)
- Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policy Act (restore EPA, FDA, CDC scientific integrity)
- Executive Office Transparency Act (immediate disclosure requirements)

**Phase 2 (Year 1): Comprehensive Reform**
- Executive Office Professional Standards and Accountability Act (merit-based civil service restoration)
- National Security Council Professionalization Act (prevent intelligence politicization)

**Phase 3 (Year 1-2): Structural Reform**
- Convert OIRA to independent commission (bipartisan, staggered terms)
- Establish Inspector General for EOP (independent oversight of White House operations)
- Create EOP ethics office with enforcement authority

**Total Estimated Cost:** $325 million annually

**Revenue Offsets:**
- Eliminate wasteful contractor spending from DOGE period: $2 billion savings
- Restore tax enforcement (IRS funding): $20 billion annually
- Corporate minimum tax enforcement: $200 billion over 10 years

**Congressional Support Strategy:**
- Bipartisan appeal: Government effectiveness benefits both parties

**Legal Challenges:**
- Separation of powers: Humphrey's Executor, Morrison v. Olson precedents support congressional authority
- Executive privilege: Narrow exception for sensitive national security, not routine policy
- Removal power: Multi-member commissions, for-cause removal protections constitutional (Seila Law exception limited)

This comprehensive legislative package provides lawyers and policymakers with the specific statutory language and legal framework to restore professional EOP operations and prevent future authoritarian abuse.

## Conclusion

The Executive Office of the President stands at the constitutional crossroads of American democracy. When functioning properly, the EOP provides presidents with expert analysis, professional coordination, and lawful execution of congressional mandates. When corrupted—as Project 2025 explicitly planned—the EOP becomes the machinery of authoritarian control: politicizing science, withholding appropriated funds, killing statutory regulations, and purging career professionals who might resist.

Project 2025's blueprint for the EOP, authored by former OMB Director Russ Vought, stated the authoritarian objective with striking clarity: "bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will." This chapter has documented how that agenda was systematically implemented:

- **OMB weaponized** to withhold appropriated funds from agencies resisting political direction, violating the Impoundment Control Act and congressional appropriations power
- **OIRA politicized** to kill regulations required by statute, substituting ideology for science and law
- **NSC purged** of career Foreign Service Officers and intelligence analysts, replacing professional expertise with political loyalists
- **Scientific advisory bodies** disbanded or stacked with industry representatives, eliminating evidence-based policy
- **Transparency eliminated** through secret policy processes, destroyed records, and obstruction of congressional oversight

The consequences extended far beyond the EOP itself. When OMB directed agencies to ignore statutory requirements, agency officials faced an impossible choice: violate the law on White House orders or face termination. When OIRA killed EPA regulations mandated by the Clean Air Act, millions of Americans continued breathing polluted air despite congressional mandate for protection. When NSC excluded career intelligence analysts, foreign policy decisions were made without professional expertise—endangering national security.

### How EOP Reforms Restore Democratic Governance

The comprehensive framework provided in this chapter addresses three dimensions:

**1. Immediate Restoration (Days 1-100)**

Executive action can immediately reverse the most egregious Project 2025 abuses:
- Restore scientific integrity policies across all EOP offices
- Reinstate career professionals wrongfully removed
- Release impounded funds unlawfully withheld by OMB
- Restore transparency through visitor logs, OIRA disclosure, and public reporting
- Rebuild advisory committees with qualified experts

These actions require only presidential will—no legislation necessary. A new administration could begin reversing authoritarian EOP practices on Day One.

**2. Legislative Codification (Year 1)**

Executive action alone proved insufficient—the Trump administration simply ignored statutory requirements when convenient. This chapter provides five comprehensive statutes codifying enforceable EOP reforms:

- **Executive Office Professional Standards and Accountability Act:** Merit-based staffing, transparency, ethics standards
- **Office of Management and Budget Independence and Integrity Act:** Prevent impoundment abuse, restore budget analysis integrity
- **National Security Council Professionalization and Oversight Act:** Ensure career expertise in national security decisions
- **Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policy Act:** Prohibit political interference in science, require evidence-based policy
- **Executive Office Transparency and Accountability Act:** Public access, congressional oversight, whistleblower protection

Each statute includes criminal penalties (5-10 years imprisonment), civil remedies (damages, attorney fees), and mandatory congressional oversight. The legal framework is designed to survive judicial review based on Humphrey's Executor, Morrison v. Olson, and congressional appropriations authority.

**3. Cultural and Institutional Transformation**

Laws and executive orders are necessary but insufficient. The restoration of democratic EOP operations requires rebuilding institutional culture:

- **Professional norms:** Career EOP employees must understand their role is providing expert analysis to inform presidential decisions, not implementing political directives that violate law
- **Accountability mechanisms:** Whistleblower protections, Inspector General oversight, and congressional access ensure that violations are reported and punished
- **Public transparency:** When EOP operations occur in public view, political abuses become more difficult and accountability becomes routine
- **Bipartisan commitment:** Both parties must commit to professional EOP operations even when politically inconvenient

### The Stakes

The Executive Office of the President is the operational center of the federal government. If corrupted, no agency can resist. If restored, professional governance becomes possible.

Project 2025 demonstrated that the presidency can become an instrument of authoritarian control through EOP weaponization. The Inspector General massacre eliminated independent oversight. The Schedule F purge eliminated merit-based civil service protections. The OMB impoundment crisis eliminated congressional control of spending. The OIRA regulatory sabotage eliminated statutory environmental and health protections.

This chapter provides the comprehensive legal and operational framework to prevent that outcome. For lawyers, it offers enforceable statutory language, constitutional analysis, and litigation strategies. For policymakers, it provides executive orders, legislative templates, and implementation timelines. For the American people, it demonstrates that professional, accountable governance is both possible and legally required.

The restoration of democratic EOP operations is not optional—it is constitutional necessity. The Take Care Clause requires faithful execution of the laws. The Appropriations Clause requires spending funds as Congress directs. The separation of powers requires presidential power exercised within constitutional bounds.

Project 2029 is the roadmap to restore what Project 2025 sought to destroy: an Executive Office of the President that serves the Constitution, the law, and the American people—not the unchecked will of an authoritarian president.
