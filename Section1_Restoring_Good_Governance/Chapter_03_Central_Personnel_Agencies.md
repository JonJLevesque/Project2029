## Historical Precedents

### Pendleton Act (1883)

- Lessons for current reforms

### Post-Watergate Reforms
- Civil Service Reform Act of 1978
- Creating MSPB and OPM
- Lessons for institutional protection

### Modern Civil Service Challenges
- Political appointee growth
- Contracting out government functions
- Balancing accountability and protection

- European professional bureaucracies
- Best practices from other democracies
- Avoiding politicization models from authoritarian states

## Conclusion

The merit-based civil service is fundamental to democratic governance. Project 2025's assault on professional government was an assault on democracy itself. By restoring and strengthening the civil service, we restore the capacity of government to serve the American people effectively, professionally, and without political bias.

The federal workforce is not the "deep state"—it's the reason government functions. These are professionals dedicated to public service: scientists protecting public health, engineers building infrastructure, analysts supporting national security, and countless others doing the essential work of government.

Project 2029 will restore their protections, rebuild their capacity, and ensure that never again can a president purge professionals for political loyalty. The American people deserve a government that works—and that requires a professional, merit-based civil service.
