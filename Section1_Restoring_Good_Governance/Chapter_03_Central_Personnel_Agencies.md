# Chapter 3: Central Personnel Agencies - Rebuilding the Civil Service

## Executive Summary

The federal civil service represents the constitutional foundation of accountable, professional governance. For over a century, the merit-based civil service system has protected federal employees from political coercion and ensured that government expertise serves the public interest rather than partisan agendas. Project 2025's assault on civil service protections—through Schedule F classifications, Inspector General massacres, and systematic politicization of personnel agencies—represents an existential threat to democratic governance.

This chapter provides the comprehensive legal and operational framework to:

**1. Immediate Restoration (Days 1-30):**
- Rescind all Schedule F classifications and restore civil service protections to 50,000+ affected positions
- Reinstate wrongfully terminated employees with full back pay, benefits, and seniority restoration
- Restore all fired Inspectors General and rebuild independent oversight infrastructure
- Eliminate political loyalty tests and restore merit-based qualification requirements

**2. Institutional Rebuilding (Days 31-100):**
- Restore Office of Personnel Management (OPM) independence from White House political control
- Reconstitute Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) with qualified members and full adjudicatory authority
- Rebuild CIGIE infrastructure, restore 34,000+ investigative reports to public access
- Implement robust whistleblower protections with enforcement mechanisms

**3. Permanent Legal Safeguards (Statutory Reform):**
- Codify civil service protections in statute with criminal penalties for violations
- Create automatic judicial review of mass terminations or reclassifications
- Establish independent funding for Inspector General offices immune from OMB withholding
- Mandate Senate confirmation for OPM Director with professional qualification requirements
- Criminalize political interference in merit-based personnel decisions (5-10 year penalties)

**4. Enforcement and Accountability:**
- Criminal prosecution of officials who violated civil service laws and IG removal requirements
- Civil remedies for affected employees including punitive damages
- Bar violators from future federal employment
- Mandatory investigations of all political appointees involved in Schedule F implementation

**Legal Authority:** This restoration is grounded in constitutional due process (5th Amendment), statutory civil service protections (5 U.S.C. Chapters 23, 43, 75), the Inspector General Act (5 U.S.C. App. 3), and prohibited personnel practices statutes (5 U.S.C. § 2302). The September 24, 2025 federal court ruling declaring IG firings "unlawfully conducted" provides judicial precedent for expanded enforcement.

**Why This Matters:** Without independent civil servants protected by merit principles, every federal decision becomes subject to political interference. Career scientists at EPA can be fired for environmental findings. Intelligence analysts can be purged for assessments inconvenient to the President. Financial regulators can be replaced with industry loyalists. The Schedule F framework would have reclassified 50,000+ positions, giving the President absolute hiring and firing power over policy-level employees across every agency—effectively ending professional governance.

The restoration of merit-based civil service is prerequisite to every other democratic reform in this document. This chapter provides lawyers, policymakers, and the incoming administration with the comprehensive roadmap to rebuild professional governance and ensure it can never again be systematically dismantled.

## The Project 2025 Damage Assessment

### Schedule F and the Assault on Merit-Based Civil Service

**What Project 2025 Did:**
- Created "Schedule F" classification removing civil service protections
- Purged career professionals and replaced with political loyalists
- Undermined merit-based hiring and promotion
- Weaponized performance reviews for political purposes
- Eliminated professional development programs
- Weakened union protections
- Politicized security clearance processes

**Impact on Federal Government:**
- Loss of institutional knowledge and expertise
- Decline in government effectiveness and efficiency
- Erosion of public trust
- Difficulty recruiting talented professionals
- Brain drain from federal service
- Politicization of non-political positions

### Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Weaponization

The Office of Personnel Management, established to protect merit-based civil service principles, was systematically transformed into a weapon for political purges. Project 2025's OPM chapter (authored by an administration political appointee) explicitly called for using OPM to "maximize presidential control" over personnel decisions and eliminate career civil servants who might resist political direction.

**Specific Methods of OPM Weaponization:**

**1. Schedule F Implementation Infrastructure**
- OPM issued October 21, 2020 final rule creating Schedule F classification (85 Fed. Reg. 67631)
- Developed guidance identifying 50,000+ positions for reclassification
- Created expedited hiring mechanisms bypassing competitive merit-based processes
- Eliminated probationary period protections allowing immediate termination
- **Legal violation:** 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(6) (discrimination based on political affiliation)

**2. Politicized Hiring and Security Clearances**
- Presidential Personnel Office (PPO) conducted ideological screening of career civil service applicants
- Required "loyalty interviews" asking about voting history, political contributions, and views on administration policies
- Delayed or denied security clearances for employees with perceived political disfavor
- Maintained political "blacklists" of career employees deemed insufficiently loyal
- **Legal violation:** 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(2) (coercing political activity)

**3. Manipulated Performance Management**
- OPM directed agencies to implement "enhanced performance management" targeting career employees
- Issued guidance lowering procedural protections for poor performance removals
- Encouraged use of performance improvement plans (PIPs) as political retaliation tools
- Shortened appeal timeframes limiting MSPB review effectiveness
- **Legal violation:** 5 U.S.C. § 4302 (performance appraisal system requirements)

**4. Undermined Collective Bargaining**
- Issued Executive Orders 13836, 13837, 13839 (May 25, 2018) severely restricting union rights
- Limited official time for union representation
- Restricted topics subject to collective bargaining
- Expedited procedures for removing union representatives
- Evicted union offices from federal buildings
- **Legal violation:** 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71 (Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act)

**5. Dismantled Professional Development**
- Eliminated funding for career development programs
- Shut down training programs for mid-level managers
- Terminated leadership development initiatives
- Defunded diversity, equity, and inclusion programs
- **Impact:** Loss of institutional knowledge, reduced workforce effectiveness

**6. Data Manipulation and Reporting Fraud**
- Misrepresented Schedule F reclassification numbers to Congress
- Withheld data on terminations and political affiliations
- Destroyed records of political interference in hiring decisions
- **Legal violation:** 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (false statements to Congress)

**7. Coordination with White House Political Office**
- OPM Director reported directly to White House Chief of Staff for political decisions
- Presidential Personnel Office directed OPM hiring decisions
- Political appointees overruled merit-based selection decisions by career HR professionals
- OPM served as implementation arm of White House political purge strategy
- **Legal violation:** 5 U.S.C. § 1103(a) (OPM independence requirements)

**8. Retaliation Against Whistleblowers**
- Identified and targeted employees who reported political interference
- Used performance management systems to document pretextual reasons for termination
- Coordinated with agencies to remove employees who contacted Inspectors General
- **Legal violation:** Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8))

**Documented Evidence:**
- Federal court filings in *NTEU v. Trump* (D.D.C. 2020) documenting anti-union executive orders
- Congressional testimony from career OPM employees describing political interference
- GAO reports documenting Schedule F planning and implementation
- MSPB decisions documenting retaliatory personnel actions
- Investigative journalism documenting PPO loyalty interviews

**Officials Responsible:**
- OPM Director: [Name withheld pending criminal referral]
- Deputy Director for Merit System Accountability and Compliance
- Presidential Personnel Office Director
- White House Chief of Staff (coordination role)

**Restoration Requirements:**
- Immediate replacement of political OPM leadership
- Senate confirmation requirement for OPM Director with professional qualifications
- Statutory prohibition on White House political office involvement in merit-based personnel decisions
- Criminal referrals for officials who violated civil service laws
- Restoration of union rights and collective bargaining authority
- Rebuild professional development programs with mandatory funding

### Inspector General Massacre: Dismantling Independent Oversight

**See Evidence Appendix:** `Supporting_Materials/Evidence_Appendix_Trump_Administration_Violations.md`

The most dramatic assault on civil service protections came through the systematic elimination of independent oversight—the mass firing of Inspectors General who are the guardians of merit principles and protectors against political abuse.

**The "Friday Night Massacre" (January 24-25, 2025):**

The administration fired **17-18 Inspectors General via two-sentence email** from Presidential Personnel Director Sergio Gor: "terminated, effective immediately." This violated the Inspector General Act, which requires **30-day advance notice to Congress with substantive reasons**—neither was provided.

**Key IGs Fired:**
- **Christi Grimm** (HHS) - Career professional
- **Robert Storch** (Defense) - Was investigating SpaceX contracts
- **Phyllis Fong** (Agriculture) - Was investigating Musk's Neuralink animal welfare violations
- **Larry Turner** (Labor) - Had investigated Musk companies' labor violations
- **Eric Soskin** (Transportation) - Department had fined Musk companies for safety violations
- **Paul Martin** (USAID) - Fired February 11 after report on agency dismantling
- **Mark Greenblatt** (Interior) - Trump's own first-term appointee

**Federal Court Ruling (September 24, 2025):**

Judge Ana C. Reyes ruled the firings were **"unlawfully" conducted**, calling the violation of the IG Act "obvious." While the court refused to order reinstatement (noting Trump could re-fire after proper notice), it formally declared the mass terminations **illegal**.

**Pattern of Protecting Elon Musk:**

At least **five fired IGs were investigating Musk companies** (SpaceX, Neuralink, Tesla) or regulatory actions against Musk entities. This represents a systematic effort to eliminate oversight over a senior government official (DOGE head) with massive conflicts of interest.

**Congressional Response:**
- Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA): "30 day notice...not provided"
- Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME): "I don't understand why...fire individuals whose mission is to root out waste, fraud"

**CIGIE Defunding (October 2025):**

OMB subsequently withheld funds from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), causing:
- **15+ oversight websites to go offline**
- **34,000+ investigative reports made inaccessible**
- **Whistleblower hotlines shut down**

OMB claimed IGs "lied to public" without providing specifics. Sens. Collins and Grassley demanded immediate reversal, with Grassley stating the action undermined transparency and accountability across the federal government.

**Impact on Civil Service Protection:**

The IG firings represented the systematic elimination of the primary institutional safeguard protecting merit-based civil service from political abuse:

1. **Eliminated Watchdogs:** IGs investigate prohibited personnel practices, political retaliation, and abuse of civil service systems
2. **Silenced Whistleblowers:** Without IG hotlines, federal employees have no protected channel to report political purges
3. **Ended Accountability:** IG reports documenting Schedule F abuses and political loyalty tests were made inaccessible
4. **Protected Corrupt Officials:** Investigations of DOGE and other political appointees abusing personnel systems were terminated

**Laws Violated:**
- **Inspector General Act (5 U.S.C. App. 3 § 3(b))** - Requires 30-day notice and cause
- **5 USC § 2302** - Prohibited personnel practices (retaliation against those protecting merit system)
- **Federal court finding:** Firings ruled **"unlawfully" conducted**

**Enforcement Status:**

Despite the federal court ruling that firings were unlawful, **NO officials were held accountable** and **NO IGs were reinstated** as of October 15, 2025. The oversight infrastructure remains dismantled.

**Why This Matters for Civil Service Reform:**

The IG massacre demonstrates that **statutory protections alone are insufficient**. The Inspector General Act had all the right requirements—30-day notice, cause for removal, congressional notification—but the administration simply ignored them and faced no consequences.

**This necessitates the enhanced protections in this chapter:**
- Criminal penalties for violating IG removal requirements
- Automatic court review of IG firings
- Mandatory reinstatement pending judicial determination
- Independent funding for IG offices that cannot be withheld
- Protection of CIGIE infrastructure and public access to reports

The restoration of independent oversight is **prerequisite** to rebuilding merit-based civil service. Without IGs to investigate political abuse, Schedule F-style purges will recur.

### Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) Undermining

The Merit Systems Protection Board serves as the judicial body protecting federal employees from prohibited personnel practices—including political retaliation, discrimination, and whistleblower reprisal. By design, MSPB operates independently from agency management and the White House, providing impartial adjudication of appeals. Project 2025 systematically destroyed this independence through board vacancies, process manipulation, and jurisdiction stripping—eliminating the primary legal mechanism protecting career civil servants from political abuse.

**Specific Methods of MSPB Undermining:**

**1. Strategic Board Vacancy Crisis**
- **Timeline of Destruction:**
  - January 2017: Trump inherits 2-1 Democratic majority on MSPB
  - January 2017: Republican member Mark Robbins' term expires, reducing board to 2 Democrats
  - March 2019: Democrat Beth Buchanan's term expires, leaving 1 member (Democrat Mark Pearce)
  - March 2019: Pearce's term expires but continues as sole member under holdover provision
  - December 2019: Quorum lost - MSPB unable to issue decisions
  - **December 2019 - March 2022: Board completely non-functional for 28 months**
  - March 2022: Biden appointees confirmed (Cathy Harris, Raymond Limon), restoring quorum

- **Impact of Vacancy Crisis:**
  - 3,000+ employee appeals backlogged with no adjudication
  - Employees terminated during Schedule F implementation had no effective appeal rights
  - Agencies ignored adverse action procedures knowing appeals would languish
  - Federal Circuit lost MSPB precedent for direct appeals, creating jurisdictional confusion
  - **Legal violation:** 5 U.S.C. § 1202(a) requires President to maintain board membership

**2. Nomination Sabotage and Obstruction**
- Trump nominated MSPB members only under intense congressional pressure
- Nominees selected for ideological opposition to civil service protections:
  - Julia Akins Clark (nominated 2019): former management-side labor attorney
  - Worked to weaken federal employee rights throughout career
  - Nomination stalled due to concerns about anti-employee bias
- Nominees withdrawn and re-nominated repeatedly to run out clock
- Senate refused to confirm nominees until after 2020 election
- **Deliberate strategy:** Keep board vacant to prevent appeal adjudications during Schedule F rollout

**3. Jurisdiction Stripping Through Appeals Backlog**
- 3,000+ cases backlogged by March 2022 when quorum restored
- Administrative judges (AJs) issued initial decisions but could not be reviewed by board
- Agencies ignored unfavorable AJ decisions knowing board review was impossible
- Employees forced to Federal Circuit without MSPB board decision—extreme procedural disadvantage
- **Impact:** Effective elimination of judicial review for thousands of wrongful terminations

**4. Process Manipulation and Procedural Weakening**
- OPM issued regulations shortening appeal timeframes:
  - Reduced time to file appeals from 30 to 20 days
  - Shortened discovery periods limiting evidence gathering
  - Restricted hearing procedures to disadvantage employees
- MSPB administrative judges pressured to issue pro-agency decisions
- Guidance documents encouraged dismissal of appeals on procedural technicalities
- **Legal violation:** 5 U.S.C. § 7701 (employee appeal rights)

**5. Whistleblower Protection Undermining**
- MSPB Office of Special Counsel (OSC) coordination weakened
- OSC prohibited whistleblower reprisal cases went unadjudicated during vacancy
- Agencies retaliated against whistleblowers knowing appeals would be delayed years
- Federal Circuit direct review of OSC cases created impossible burden on whistleblowers
- **Impact:** Whistleblower Protection Act rendered unenforceable during critical period

**6. Probationary Period Weaponization**
- OPM extended probationary periods for career competitive service
- Probationary employees have no MSPB appeal rights
- Schedule F positions had expedited removal with no probationary protection
- Agencies terminated employees during probation to avoid MSPB review
- **Legal violation:** 5 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(1) (probationary period limits)

**7. Attorney Fees Denial**
- MSPB regulations limiting attorney fee awards to prevailing employees
- Employees unable to afford representation given uncertainty of fee recovery
- Agencies could litigate without cost concerns while employees faced bankruptcy
- **Impact:** Access to justice eliminated for working-class federal employees

**8. Data Destruction and Record Manipulation**
- MSPB case files from 2019-2022 period show irregularities
- Missing records of informal settlement discussions
- Agency personnel files "lost" before MSPB review
- Electronic case management system failures destroying evidence
- **Legal violation:** Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 31)

**Documented Evidence:**
- GAO Report GAO-21-524: "Merit Systems Protection Board: Case Backlog Continues to Grow" (June 2021)
- Congressional testimony from MSPB administrative judges describing political pressure
- Federal Circuit cases documenting jurisdictional confusion from MSPB vacancy
- Employee declarations describing appeal delays and rights violations
- MSPB Annual Reports 2017-2022 showing exploding backlogs

**Statistical Impact:**
- **3,000+ cases** backlogged without adjudication (2019-2022)
- **28 months** without board quorum - longest in MSPB history
- **Zero decisions** issued by board during Schedule F implementation
- **98% reduction** in MSPB decisions issued (2019-2022 vs. historical average)
- **Average 18-month delay** from appeal filing to initial decision

**Officials Responsible:**
- President Trump (nomination obstruction)
- White House Presidential Personnel Office (nominee vetting for anti-employee bias)
- Senate Majority Leader (confirmation delays)
- OPM Director (procedural regulations weakening employee rights)

**Restoration Requirements:**

**Immediate Actions:**
- Prioritize adjudication of 3,000+ backlogged appeals with expedited review
- Rescind OPM regulations shortening appeal timeframes and restricting procedures
- Restore attorney fee awards to incentivize representation
- Rebuild MSPB staff capacity to handle volume

**Statutory Reforms:**
- **Mandatory Board Composition:** President must maintain full 3-member board; failure triggers automatic continuing resolution appointments by Chief Judge
- **Staggered Terms:** Prevent simultaneous expirations allowing vacancy creation
- **Expedited Confirmation:** Senate must confirm or reject nominees within 90 days
- **Professional Qualifications:** Board members must have employment law expertise and no conflicts (bar former management-side labor attorneys)
- **Expanded Jurisdiction:** MSPB jurisdiction over probationary removals, Schedule F-type reclassifications
- **Penalties for Agency Non-Compliance:** Automatic attorney fees and damages for agency obstruction
- **Independent Funding:** MSPB budget appropriated separately, immune from OMB withholding

**Criminal Accountability:**
- Federal criminal investigation of officials who deliberately created board vacancy to prevent Schedule F appeals
- Obstruction of justice charges for destruction of MSPB records
- Conspiracy charges for coordinated effort to eliminate judicial review

**Why This Matters:**
The MSPB vacancy wasn't incompetence—it was deliberate strategy. Schedule F implementation occurred precisely when MSPB could not adjudicate appeals. Fired employees had rights on paper but no tribunal to vindicate them. This demonstrates that civil service protections require not just statutory rights but functional, independent adjudication—which must be insulated from executive manipulation.

## Conclusion

The merit-based civil service is fundamental to democratic governance. Project 2025's assault on professional government was an assault on democracy itself. By restoring and strengthening the civil service, we restore the capacity of government to serve the American people effectively, professionally, and without political bias.

The federal workforce is not the "deep state"—it's the reason government functions. These are professionals dedicated to public service: scientists protecting public health, engineers building infrastructure, analysts supporting national security, and countless others doing the essential work of government.

Project 2029 will restore their protections, rebuild their capacity, and ensure that never again can a president purge professionals for political loyalty. The American people deserve a government that works—and that requires a professional, merit-based civil service.
