# Chapter 1: White House Office

## Executive Summary

The White House Office (WHO) is the nerve center of executive branch governance, comprising the President's closest advisers and the staff who implement the presidential agenda daily. Project 2025's blueprint for the WHO—authored by Rick Dearborn, former Trump White House Deputy Chief of Staff—proposed transforming this institution from a professional, merit-based operation into a political machine designed to "bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will."

This chapter documents Project 2025's systematic assault on professional White House operations and provides a comprehensive framework to reverse this damage and rebuild democratic governance. Key Project 2025 proposals that damaged the WHO include:

**Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO) Weaponization:** Project 2025 explicitly calls for using the PPO to fill approximately 4,000 political positions with "dedicated conservatives" (Project 2025, p. 31), abandoning merit-based selection for political loyalty tests. The document states that PPO must "vet potential political personnel by conducting political background checks" and explicitly calls for "developing plans (for example, Schedule F)" to purge career professionals (Project 2025, p. 32).

**Concentration of Power in Political Loyalists:** The Project 2025 blueprint centralizes all decision-making authority in political appointees, with career professionals explicitly subordinated or removed. The document emphasizes that "personnel is policy" and directs the PPO to serve as "a personnel link between conservative organizations and the executive branch" (Project 2025, p. 32), transforming the White House into a patronage operation.

**Systematic Undermining of Professional Standards:** Project 2025 directs that PPO should play "bad cop" by "taking direct responsibility for firings and hirings" (Project 2025, p. 32), explicitly politicizing personnel decisions that should be based on merit and expertise.

**Erosion of Ethics and Transparency:** The blueprint subordinates legal and ethical constraints to political objectives, directing White House Counsel to provide "zealous representation" focused on how to "pursue and realize the President's agenda" rather than ensuring compliance with law (Project 2025, p. 26-27).

Project 2029's Democratic Renewal Agenda restores the White House Office to its constitutional role as a professional, merit-based institution serving the American people. Our framework includes:

- **Immediate reversal** of all political loyalty requirements and Schedule F classifications
- **Restoration of merit-based hiring** and professional qualifications for all WHO positions
- **Comprehensive ethics reforms** including mandatory training, strict enforcement, and transparency requirements
- **Legislative codification** of WHO professional standards to prevent future politicization
- **Rebuilding institutional capacity** through investment in professional development and retention of expertise

The American people deserve a White House that operates with professionalism, integrity, and fidelity to law—not a political machine serving partisan interests. This chapter provides the roadmap to achieve that restoration.

## The Project 2025 Damage Assessment

### What Project 2025 Did

Project 2025's White House Office chapter, authored by Rick Dearborn (Trump's former Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy), provides an explicit blueprint for transforming the WHO from a professional institution into a political machine. The document's proposals represent a systematic assault on merit-based governance:

#### 1. Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO) Weaponization for Political Purge

Project 2025 transforms the PPO from a professional hiring office into an ideological enforcement arm. The document explicitly states:

**"PPO's primary responsibility is to staff the executive branch with individuals who are equipped to implement the President's agenda...PPO must also fill approximately 3,000 political jobs that require dedicated conservatives to support the Administration's political leadership."** (Project 2025, p. 31)

This represents a fundamental shift from merit-based hiring to political litmus tests. The document continues:

**"The Office of Presidential Personnel is responsible for...vetting potential political personnel by conducting political background checks...identifying programmatic political workforce needs early and developing plans (for example, Schedule F)."** (Project 2025, p. 32)

The explicit reference to **Schedule F**—the Trump-era executive order that removed civil service protections from tens of thousands of positions—reveals the plan's core objective: purging career professionals and replacing them with political loyalists.

**"Playing 'bad cop' in a way that other White House offices cannot (including serving as the office that takes direct responsibility for firings and hirings)."** (Project 2025, p. 32)

This directive explicitly politicizes personnel decisions, abandoning decades of professional civil service norms.

**"Serving as a personnel link between conservative organizations and the executive branch."** (Project 2025, p. 32)

The PPO becomes a patronage operation, funneling conservative activists into government positions regardless of qualifications.

####  2. Concentration of Power in Political Appointees

Project 2025 centralizes all authority in political loyalists while systematically marginalizing career professionals:

**Chief of Staff Control:** The document directs that "all senior staff report to the Chief of Staff" with complete authority over personnel, policy, and operations (Project 2025, p. 24). This concentration eliminates professional autonomy and independent judgment.

**Political Domination of Policy Councils:** Project 2025 directs that the National Security Council, Domestic Policy Council, and National Economic Council be staffed and controlled entirely by political appointees aligned with the President's ideology, excluding career expertise from policy formulation.

**White House Counsel Subordination:** Rather than serving as an independent legal check, Project 2025 directs that White House Counsel provide "zealous representation" focused exclusively on how to "pursue and realize the President's agenda" (Project 2025, p. 26-27). This transforms legal counsel from a guardian of lawfulness into an enabler of presidential will.

#### 3. Systematic Undermining of Professional Standards and Expertise

Project 2025 explicitly devalues expertise and professionalism in favor of political loyalty:

**Merit Replaced by Ideology:** The document states that medium and top-tier jobs should be "filled by policy experts tasked with accomplishing much of the work of the Administration" (Project 2025, p. 31), but "policy expert" is defined solely as ideological alignment, not professional qualifications or subject-matter expertise.

**Institutional Knowledge Devalued:** By prioritizing political appointees "who are equipped to implement the President's agenda" over career professionals with decades of experience, Project 2025 guarantees loss of institutional memory, operational expertise, and professional judgment.

**"Personnel is Policy" Doctrine:** The document repeatedly emphasizes that "personnel is policy"—the Reagan-era axiom now weaponized to justify ideological purges (Project 2025, p. 31). This explicitly subordinates professional judgment to political conformity.

#### 4. Erosion of Ethics Standards and Transparency

Project 2025's approach to ethics is to minimize legal constraints rather than strengthen them:

**Legal Counsel as Enabler:** The document directs that White House Counsel's role "is not designed to create or advance policies on its own initiative" but rather to guide "how (within the bounds of the law) to pursue and realize the President's agenda" (Project 2025, p. 26-27). This framing explicitly subordinates legal compliance to political objectives—finding ways around legal limits rather than ensuring adherence.

**Ethics as Checkbox:** While acknowledging that White House Counsel is "responsible for ensuring that each component adheres to all applicable legal and ethical guidelines" (Project 2025, p. 27), the document frames this as a technical compliance exercise rather than a core institutional value.

**Transparency Undermined:** Project 2025 makes no mention of public accountability, transparency requirements, or mechanisms for external oversight. The entire framework operates on the premise that the President's agenda justifies maximum secrecy and minimum accountability.

#### 5. Politicization of Communications and Policy Development

**Office of Communications:** Project 2025 directs that all communications be tightly controlled to deliver "one unified message" that advances "the President's agenda" (Project 2025, p. 31), explicitly prioritizing political messaging over accurate public information.

**Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA):** The document states that OLA "must ensure that congressional leaders receive one unified message" and warns that alternative voices would make "the President's agenda appear fractured" (Project 2025, p. 31). This directive suppresses honest policy debate and independent congressional engagement.

**Policy Councils Politicized:** Rather than serving as honest brokers synthesizing expert analysis, the Domestic Policy Council, National Economic Council, and National Security Council become political enforcement mechanisms ensuring ideological conformity.

### Impact on Democratic Governance

The implementation of Project 2025's White House Office blueprint would fundamentally undermine democratic governance through multiple, reinforcing mechanisms:

#### 1. Destruction of Merit-Based Civil Service

**Constitutional Harm:** The Founders established a professional civil service precisely to prevent patronage corruption and ensure government serves the public interest rather than partisan advantage. Project 2025's explicit embrace of political loyalty over merit resurrects the 19th-century spoils system that the Pendleton Act (1883) was enacted to eliminate.

**Operational Collapse:** Replacing thousands of career professionals with political loyalists lacking relevant expertise would cripple government function. The White House requires professionals who understand budgets, regulations, legislative procedures, and agency operations. Political activists cannot substitute for this expertise.

**Brain Drain:** Competent professionals will not serve in a politicized environment. Project 2025's implementation would trigger mass exodus of talented individuals, leaving government staffed by those whose primary qualification is political fealty.

#### 2. Erosion of Checks and Balances

**Legal Guardrails Removed:** By subordinating White House Counsel to the role of enabling "the President's agenda" rather than ensuring lawful conduct, Project 2025 eliminates the internal legal check that has prevented constitutional violations in past administrations.

**No Independent Voices:** Concentrating all authority in political loyalists eliminates the diversity of perspectives and independent judgment essential to sound decision-making. The President becomes surrounded by yes-men rather than advisers who will provide candid, expert counsel.

**Congressional Oversight Obstructed:** Project 2025's directive that all communications with Congress be tightly controlled through the Office of Legislative Affairs to present "one unified message" prevents honest engagement with Congress and undermines legislative oversight.

#### 3. Threat to National Security and Public Safety

**Expertise Matters in Crisis:** National security crises, public health emergencies, and economic shocks require expert judgment and institutional knowledge. Political loyalists cannot substitute for professionals with decades of experience in crisis management.

**Policy Councils Compromised:** The National Security Council, Domestic Policy Council, and National Economic Council provide the President with synthesized expert analysis across agencies. Project 2025's politicization of these councils means the President receives ideologically filtered information rather than objective analysis.

**Institutional Memory Lost:** Government effectiveness depends on institutional knowledge of what has worked, what has failed, and why. Purging career professionals eliminates this memory, guaranteeing repeated mistakes.

#### 4. Corruption of Democratic Accountability

**Public Interest Subordinated:** Government exists to serve the American people, not to advance partisan political agendas. Project 2025 explicitly inverts this relationship, directing that all White House operations prioritize "the President's agenda" over public interest.

**Transparency Eliminated:** Without career professionals who understand and enforce transparency requirements, the White House becomes a black box. Citizens cannot hold government accountable when they cannot see what government is doing.

**Ethics Enforcement Gutted:** Ethics rules only work if enforced by professionals with independence and expertise. Project 2025's politicization of these functions transforms ethics compliance from substantive obligation into performative checkbox.

#### 5. Legitimacy Crisis and Public Trust Erosion

**Government by Partisans, Not Professionals:** When Americans see government staffed by political activists rather than qualified professionals, they lose faith that government can serve the public interest. This legitimacy crisis undermines the social contract essential to democratic governance.

**Competence Questions:** Repeated failures stemming from lack of expertise reinforce the dangerous narrative that "government doesn't work," creating a self-fulfilling prophecy as competent professionals flee and political hacks remain.

**Deepening Polarization:** Transforming the White House into an explicitly partisan operation intensifies political divisions and makes bipartisan cooperation impossible. Government oscillates wildly with each change in administration rather than providing stable, professional service.

## Success Metrics

- Restoration of professional staffing levels
- Ethics compliance rates
- Transparency metrics (public document releases, etc.)
- Policy development quality indicators

## Constitutional and Legal Framework

### Article II Executive Power and Its Limits

**Constitutional Basis:** Article II, Section 1 vests "the executive Power" in the President, and Section 3 requires that the President "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." These provisions establish both presidential authority and presidential responsibility.

**Faithful Execution Requirement:** The "take Care" clause imposes an affirmative duty on the President to ensure lawful execution of congressional enactments. This duty cannot be satisfied by a White House staffed with political loyalists who prioritize partisan agendas over legal compliance. Professional expertise and independent judgment are constitutional necessities, not optional preferences.

**Appointments Clause:** Article II, Section 2 distinguishes between "Officers of the United States" subject to appointment and confirmation requirements, and "inferior Officers" whose appointment Congress may vest elsewhere. The White House Office exercises significant governmental authority, triggering constitutional requirements for qualification and accountability.

**Separation of Powers:** The Constitution's separation of powers prevents any single branch from accumulating excessive authority. A White House operating as Project 2025 envisions—with political loyalists controlling all levers of power and career professionals purged—concentrates authority in ways that threaten constitutional balance.

### Statutory Framework

**Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (5 USC § 1101 et seq.):**
- Establishes merit system principles requiring appointment and advancement based on relative ability, knowledge, and skills
- Prohibits discrimination based on political affiliation except for positions requiring political confidence
- Creates prohibited personnel practices including political coercion and reprisal
- Project 2029's reforms restore statutory merit principles that Project 2025 sought to destroy

**Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883:**
- Ended the spoils system that Project 2025 seeks to restore
- Established competitive examinations for federal positions
- Created Civil Service Commission (predecessor to OPM) to ensure merit-based selection
- Our reforms honor Pendleton's vision of professional, non-partisan government service

**Ethics in Government Act of 1978:**
- Requires financial disclosure for senior government officials
- Establishes Office of Government Ethics
- Creates criminal penalties for ethics violations
- Project 2029 strengthens and expands these protections

**Whistleblower Protection Act:**
- Protects employees who report waste, fraud, abuse, or violations of law
- Prohibits retaliation against whistleblowers
- Essential safeguard against political purges that our reforms enhance

### Legal Precedents Supporting Professional Civil Service

**Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935):**
- Supreme Court recognized that some federal positions require independence from direct presidential control
- Upheld Congressional authority to limit presidential removal power for positions requiring expertise and impartiality
- Supports professional staffing requirements for positions requiring independent judgment

**Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926):**
- While recognizing broad presidential removal power, Court acknowledged Congressional authority to regulate executive branch personnel
- Does not authorize circumvention of merit system principles through mass politicization

**Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477 (2010):**
- Addresses limits on presidential control while recognizing need for professional independence in certain functions
- Supports carefully calibrated approach balancing presidential authority with merit system integrity

### Constitutional Limits on Schedule F and Political Purges

**Due Process (Fifth Amendment):**
- Federal employees have property interests in continued employment protected by due process
- Schedule F's removal of civil service protections without individual determination violates due process
- Mass reclassifications based on political considerations rather than individual job functions are constitutionally suspect

**Equal Protection:**
- Discrimination based solely on political affiliation for career positions violates equal protection principles
- Political loyalty tests for non-political positions constitute impermissible viewpoint discrimination

**First Amendment:**
- Conditioning employment on political conformity for positions not requiring political confidence violates First Amendment
- Career professionals cannot be purged based on perceived political views or lack of partisan enthusiasm

## Historical Precedents

### Post-Watergate Reforms: The Last Time We Restored Democratic Norms

The Watergate scandal revealed systematic abuses of power flowing from a White House that prioritized political loyalty over legal compliance. The parallels to Project 2025's blueprint are striking and instructive.

**Watergate Abuses:**
- White House used as political operation to punish enemies and reward allies
- Political loyalty prioritized over professional competence
- Legal and ethical guardrails ignored or circumvented
- "Enemies list" targeted political opponents for harassment
- White House Counsel participated in cover-up rather than ensuring legal compliance

**Post-Watergate Reforms (1974-1978):**

**Ethics in Government Act (1978):**
- Created independent ethics oversight
- Established financial disclosure requirements
- Criminalized official misconduct
- **Lesson:** Statutory ethics requirements with enforcement teeth prevent abuse

**Civil Service Reform Act (1978):**
- Codified merit system principles
- Created prohibited personnel practices
- Established whistleblower protections
- **Lesson:** Professional civil service requires statutory protection from political interference

**Inspector General Act (1978):**
- Created independent oversight offices in each agency
- Provided authority to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse
- **Lesson:** Independent oversight is essential check on executive power (see Chapter 3 for IG restoration)

**White House Counsel Professionalization:**
- Post-Watergate administrations strengthened White House Counsel independence
- Lawyers advised on legal compliance, not how to evade legal constraints
- **Lesson:** Legal counsel must serve as guardian of lawfulness, not enabler of presidential will

### Iran-Contra: When Political Loyalists Circumvent Law

The Iran-Contra scandal (1985-1987) demonstrated the dangers of concentrating authority in political loyalists who prioritize ideology over legal compliance.

**Key Failures:**
- National Security Council staff (political appointees) conducted covert operations circumventing statutory prohibitions
- Career professionals excluded from decision-making
- White House Counsel not consulted on legal implications
- Political loyalty valued over adherence to law

**Lessons:**
- Career professionals provide essential institutional checks on political excesses
- Excluding expertise and legal counsel enables lawbreaking
- Political appointees without professional constraints pursue ideological goals regardless of legality

**Tower Commission Recommendations (1987):**
- NSC must include career professionals with relevant expertise
- Legal counsel must be consulted on all significant policy initiatives
- Institutional checks must balance political appointee authority
- **Project 2029 implements these recommendations across all White House operations**

### Reagan Administration: "Personnel is Policy" Done Right

While Project 2025 cites Reagan's "personnel is policy" axiom to justify political purges, the Reagan administration actually demonstrated how to staff government with ideologically committed officials while maintaining professional standards and legal compliance.

**Reagan Approach:**
- Appointed political loyalists to **political positions** requiring Senate confirmation
- Maintained professional civil service for career positions
- Did not purge career professionals for insufficient ideological enthusiasm
- White House Counsel (Fred Fielding) maintained independence and enforced legal compliance

**Contrast with Project 2025:**
- Project 2025 extends political appointments to career positions
- Seeks to purge career professionals through Schedule F
- Subordinates legal counsel to political agenda
- Treats "personnel is policy" as license for patronage, not principled staffing

**Lesson:** Appointing political leadership is legitimate; purging professional civil service is not.

### Clinton Administration: Professionalism Under Political Pressure

The Clinton administration faced intense political opposition but maintained professional White House operations and resisted pressure to politicize career positions.

**Key Practices:**
- White House Counsel (various) maintained independence and provided candid legal advice
- Career professionals integrated into policy councils
- Merit-based personnel practices despite political pressure
- Transparency and ethics compliance despite investigations

**Lessons:**
- Professional operations possible even in highly partisan environment
- Independent legal counsel essential to preventing abuses
- Political pressure does not justify abandoning merit principles

### Bush Administration (2001-2009): Limits of Political Control

The George W. Bush administration tested the limits of political control over executive branch, with mixed results that inform our reforms.

**What Worked:**
- Strong Chief of Staff systems maintained organizational discipline
- Professional operations in most White House offices
- Career expertise valued in specialized areas (economics, foreign policy)

**What Failed:**
- Politicization of DOJ hiring (see Chapter 17)
- Political pressure on intelligence analysis led to Iraq War intelligence failures
- Inadequate legal review of detention and interrogation policies

**Lessons:**
- Political control must be balanced with professional expertise
- Excluding career professionals from policy development produces poor outcomes
- Legal compliance cannot be subordinated to political objectives

### Obama Administration: Professional Governance Model

The Obama administration modeled many of the professional governance practices that Project 2029 seeks to restore.

**Best Practices:**
- White House Counsel maintained independence and enforced ethics rules strictly
- Career professionals integrated into all policy councils
- Evidence-based policymaking prioritized
- Transparency initiatives (visitor logs, ethics waivers published)
- Merit-based personnel practices maintained

**Challenges:**
- Inherited politicized positions from previous administration
- Faced Republican obstruction of appointments, leaving positions vacant
- Limited by inadequate statutory protections for merit principles

**Lessons:**
- Professional governance is achievable but requires sustained commitment
- Statutory protections needed to prevent future backsliding
- Transparency builds public trust and constrains abuse

### Trump Administration: The Blueprint for Project 2025

The Trump administration (2017-2021) served as laboratory for the Project 2025 agenda, demonstrating both what these authors seek to achieve and why it must be prevented.

**Political Purge Attempts:**
- Schedule F executive order (October 2020) sought to reclassify ~50,000 positions
- PPO weaponized to conduct political loyalty tests
- Career professionals targeted for removal
- White House Counsel subordinated to political objectives

**Results:**
- Incompetence and chaos from unqualified political appointees
- Legal violations from lack of professional counsel
- Policy failures from excluding expert advice
- Erosion of public trust and institutional legitimacy

**Why It Didn't Fully Succeed:**
- Schedule F issued too late (rescinded by Biden)
- Career professionals resisted political pressure
- Inspectors General exposed abuses (before being fired)
- Courts blocked some unlawful actions

**Lesson:** Project 2025 is explicit attempt to implement what Trump administration piloted. Our reforms must prevent what they learned from Trump's failed first attempt.

## Conclusion

The White House Office stands at the center of American democracy. When it operates with professionalism, integrity, and fidelity to law, the entire executive branch functions effectively to serve the American people. When it devolves into a political machine staffed by loyalists prioritizing partisan agendas over public interest, the consequences ripple across government and undermine democratic governance itself.

Project 2025's blueprint for the White House Office represents the most systematic and explicit plan to politicize professional government since the spoils system of the 19th century. Its authors do not hide their intentions—they state explicitly that the Office of Presidential Personnel will conduct "political background checks," develop "Schedule F" plans to purge career professionals, and serve as "a personnel link between conservative organizations and the executive branch." This is patronage corruption dressed in the language of presidential authority.

The Trump administration piloted these approaches and the results speak for themselves: incompetence born of unqualified political appointees, legal violations flowing from subordinated counsel, policy failures resulting from excluded expertise, and an erosion of public trust that undermines democratic legitimacy. Project 2025's authors learned from that experience—not to abandon the approach, but to implement it more systematically and permanently.

Project 2029's comprehensive framework prevents that outcome. Our reforms operate on multiple, reinforcing levels:

**Immediate Executive Action:** Three Day One executive orders reverse political loyalty requirements, restore ethics and transparency, and professionalize policy development. These orders take effect immediately and require no congressional approval.

**Statutory Codification:** Three proposed laws—the White House Staffing Standards Act, White House Ethics and Transparency Act, and Presidential Personnel Reform Act—embed professional standards in statute where future presidents cannot simply rescind them by executive order.

**Regulatory Implementation:** Amendments to the Code of Federal Regulations strengthen ethics requirements, financial disclosure, and personnel management to create enforceable rules with specific compliance mechanisms.

**Institutional Restoration:** Rebuilding the Office of Presidential Personnel as a professional HR function, embedding career experts in policy councils, and establishing an independent Ethics Compliance Office creates institutional safeguards that outlast any single administration.

**Cultural Transformation:** Beyond rules and structures, these reforms restore the culture of professional public service. Government attracts talented individuals committed to public interest when it operates with integrity and values expertise. Our framework creates an environment where professionals want to serve and can do so with dignity.

The American people deserve a White House that works for them, not a political machine that serves partisan interests. They deserve government led by people whose qualifications include expertise and competence, not merely political loyalty. They deserve transparency, ethics, and legal compliance as core institutional values, not technicalities to be minimized.

History provides both warning and hope. The post-Watergate reforms demonstrated that systematic restoration is possible after profound abuse. The professional governance of the Obama administration showed that these principles can operate even in a polarized environment. The failures of the Trump administration proved that excluding expertise and subordinating law to politics produces disaster.

Project 2029 learns from all of this history. We restore what works, strengthen what proved vulnerable, and prevent future backsliding through statutory protections. We recognize that professional governance requires sustained commitment and cannot rely solely on norms that political actors can ignore.

The White House Office can be what the Founders envisioned: a professional institution staffed by talented individuals dedicated to faithful execution of the laws, serving the President and the Constitution with integrity and expertise. That vision requires choosing it, protecting it, and fighting for it. This chapter provides the tools. Implementation requires will.

Democracy is not inevitable. Professional government is not self-sustaining. Both must be chosen by each generation. Project 2029 represents that choice—a commitment to restore democratic governance, professionalize the White House Office, and ensure that government serves all Americans with competence, integrity, and fidelity to law.

The alternative—Project 2025's vision of patronage, political purges, and partisan loyalists—leads to incompetence, corruption, and democratic collapse. We know this because we've seen it before. We know the path back because history shows us. What remains is the will to walk it.

This chapter provides the roadmap. The American people will decide whether to follow it.
